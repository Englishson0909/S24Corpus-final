Examining 'Very' Across Written and Spoken Corpora: A Corpus Linguistics Approach

1. Introuduction 

Corpus research has provided extensive data on how often words are used in texts and the typical patterns in which they appear. This information helps prioritize which vocabulary and phrases should be taught to learners, based on their real-world relevance and frequency. Unlike traditional methods that focused on teaching grammar rules by difficulty, a lexical approach emphasizes teaching vocabulary based on its practical usage in everyday language. This approach ensures learners acquire language skills that are more effective and applicable in real-life contexts. Additionally, corpus studies emphasize the importance of teaching collocations—words that frequently occur together in natural language. Mastering collocations enhances fluency and naturalness in language use, reflecting how native speakers naturally express themselves. By incorporating collocations and frequently used vocabulary into language instruction, educators can better prepare learners to understand and use language proficiently in various contexts. Thus, integrating corpus-based lexical research into language teaching not only makes learning materials more relevant and practical but also supports learners in developing communication skills that closely align with real-world language use. Well-selected chunks in the syllabus offer the learner the practical value of being among the most frequent, and hence most useful, elements of the language. (Lewis et al., 1997)

2. Literature Review

Corpus Linguistics

Although corpus-based studies of language structure can look back on a tradition of at least a hundred years, there is no general agreement as to what exactly constitutes corpus linguistics. "The investigation of linguistic research questions that have been framed in terms of the conditional distribution of linguistic phenomena in a linguistic corpus" (Stefanowitsch, 2020, p215).
Corpus linguistics is perhaps best described for the moment in simple terms as the study of language based on examples of “real life” language use. (McEnery & Wilson 2001: 1).


Collocation

Collocation is the way words naturally group together in a text. It can be measured by seeing how likely it is that certain words will appear near each other (Halliday, 1961, p. 276). Every word has a range of other words it usually appears with, some more likely than others, based on how we use language. Words are organized by specific rules and patterns (Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 215). For example, in grammar, certain rules decide the order of words. Usually, a definite article comes before nouns, adjectives, or adverbs that describe those adjectives, but not before other articles or verbs. Also, a transitive verb generally follows its direct object unless the sentence structure changes. This verb might be followed by elements that start a noun phrase, like a pronoun or a determiner.
From a meaning perspective, certain verbs expect specific kinds of direct objects. For instance, the verb "drink" is typically used with liquids like water or coffee. You wouldn't use "drink" with non-liquid nouns like "bread" or "guitar." This matching of verbs and objects shows a deep connection between grammar rules and how we understand the world. Also, the main topic of a text helps determine which words appear together, making sure they all relate to the same subject.
Furthermore, words in a text naturally tend to group with some words more than others, forming patterns that are not always predicted by basic language rules. 

chi-squared test

In corpus linguistics, researchers have several significant tests at their disposal, such as the chi-squared test, the Student’s t-test, and Wilson’s rank sum test. (McEnery, 2019) Here, we will focus specifically on the chi-squared test. This test is frequently used because it is sensitive and does not require the data to be normally distributed, which is often the case with linguistic data. Additionally, in 2 x 2 tables — a typical setup in linguistic studies — the chi-squared test is straightforward to apply, even without specialized software. One notable limitation of the chi-squared test is its unreliability with very small frequencies. It is also important to note that the test cannot be used with proportional data such as percentages since it assumes that differences in corpus size do not matter. Essentially, the chi-squared test assesses how the observed frequencies in a study compare to the frequencies one would expect by chance alone. When the observed and expected frequencies are similar, it is less likely that the observed outcomes are due to chance. 
Conversely, significant differences between these frequencies suggest a real disparity, such as variations in language use between two groups. To analyze the results of a chi-squared test, one must first determine the degrees of freedom, calculated by multiplying the number of rows minus one by the number of columns minus one. After calculating the degrees of freedom, researchers consult a chi-square table to find the nearest value and corresponding probability. A probability close to zero indicates a strong likelihood that the observed difference is not due to chance. A value near one, however, suggests the opposite. In practice, the cutoff for determining statistical significance is usually set at a probability of less than 0.05. Results yielding probabilities below this threshold are considered significant, whereas those above are not deemed significant. This method helps linguists confirm whether observed linguistic patterns are statistically meaningful.


Intensifiers 

Intensifiers are adverbs that enhance the words they modify and are crucial for exploring sociolinguistic differences. According to Bulgin et al. (2008), they are particularly valuable because they are easy to identify, frequently evolve over time, and show significant social correlations. These linguistic tools are used extensively in both spoken and written language to amplify expressiveness and highlight the emotions and attitudes of the speaker or writer.
Intensifiers function by either increasing or decreasing the intensity of the language used (Núñez-Pertejo & Palacios-Martínez, 2018). Bolinger (1972) defines them as modifiers that can adjust the intensity of a quality in any direction, while Allerton (1987) describes their primary role as similar to adverbs of degree, typically modifying adjectives.
Historically, intensifiers fall into two main categories: amplifiers and downtoners. Amplifiers, such as "absolutely" and "totally," push expressions to their highest intensity, whereas downtoners lessen the impact. Another subgroup of amplifiers, known as boosters—like "very" and "really"—raise intensity to a high level, though not to the maximum (Stoffel, 1901; Quirk et al., 1985).
In contemporary English, these adverb modifiers that boost meaning are often discussed. Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik (1985) classify them as part of a broader group of linguistic devices called amplifiers, which 'scale upwards from an assumed norm.' Within this group, maximizers indicate the upper extreme of a scale, and boosters signify a higher degree but not the utmost. This article will examine both maximizers and boosters under the broader term of 'intensifier,' highlighting their roles in enriching communication and contributing to a nuanced understanding of language dynamics.

(1) Maximizers: 
(a) My mom’s just like absolutely great. 
(b) I’m completely independent. 
(c) It’s all entirely different. 

(2) Boosters: 
(a) I’m really lucky that someone like my two really good friends
(b) And then the teacher said, ‘You know, that’s very dangerous.
(c) It’s so funny he thinks he’s so cool. 
(d) I found the mental patients ah extremely interesting 
(e) She was awful tired, you know, she was sleeping a lot.

Very

very is regarded as the oldest among the primary intensifiers, with its usage as an intensifier tracing back to the fourteenth century. It is reported to be the most frequent intensifier in contemporary English. (Tagliamonte, 2008). Reflecting this trend, "very" appears most frequently in Korean textbooks. However, many studies suggest that the use of "very" is diminishing in strength. (Tagliamonte, 2008)

3.	Methodology 
  
*	Data Description
   
A.	Spoken data : TED Talks are free online videos from experts on various topics, including communication. The selected TED Talks are between 6 and more than 18 minutes long, providing sufficient content for analysis. We removed speakers with strong accents to ensure clear speech patterns and deleted all time stamps and speaker names to focus on the content. After cleaning data, we combined them into a single dataset. This dataset, saved in CSV format, is ready for analysis using computational tools.

B.	Written data : The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is a large collection of American English texts used for language research. For our study, we focused on COCA texts about communication to see how people use language in different situations. We removed texts with strong regional accents to keep the language patterns clear and uniform. We also deleted all time stamps and author names to focus only on the content. After cleaning the texts to remove extra information, we combined them into one dataset and saved it in CSV format for easy analysis. To ensure uniform lexical size between the two datasets, the COCA texts were reduced to match the lexical size of the TED transcripts. (219,507 words)

Hypothesis testing using chi-square test (Frequency data)
  
* RQ1 
Null Hypothesis (H0): The frequency of "very" is independent of the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA).
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The frequency of "very" is dependent of the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA).

Chi-squared test result: The Chi-squared test of independence was applied to assess if the observed differences in frequeny of very across text types were statistically significant ( χ2=103.95755 , df = 1, p<0.01 ).
Interpretation: The Chi-squared statistic of 103.95755 with 1 degree of freedom and a p-value of p<0.01 suggests that there is a statistically significant association between text type (TED vs. COCA) and the frequency of the word "very". The observed differences between actual and expected frequencies are significant at the conventional significance level of 0.05 (and even much lower thresholds).
Conclusion: The test results indicate that the type of text (TED vs. COCA) significantly influences the frequency of the word "very". This significant difference suggests that the usage of "very" varies considerably between spoken (TED) and written (COCA) texts. Language researchers and educators might consider these differences when analyzing language use in different contexts or when designing language learning materials that target different types of text. 


* RQ2 
Null Hypothesis: The distributional patterns of "very" as an adverb and adjective are independent of the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA).
Alternative Hypothesis: The distributional patterns of "very" as an adverb and adjective are dependent on the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA).

Chi-squared test result: The Chi-squared test of independence was applied to assess if the observed differences in the distributional patterns of "very" as an adverb and adjective are independent of the type of text. The test was not statistically significant (χ2=0.0641, df=1, p=0.8).

Interpretation: The Chi-squared statistic of 0.0641 with 1 degree of freedom and a p-value of 0.8 suggests that there is no statistically significant association between the distribution patterns of "very" as an adverb and adjective and the type of text (TED vs. COCA). The observed differences between actual and expected frequencies are not significant at the conventional significance level of 0.05.

Conclusion: The test results indicate that the type of text (TED vs. COCA) does not significantly influence the distribution of the word "very" as an adverb and adjective. This lack of significant difference suggests that the usage of "very" as an adverb and adjective is similar between spoken (TED) and written (COCA) texts. Language researchers and educators might consider that these similarities imply consistent usage patterns of "very" across different types of texts when analyzing language use or designing language learning materials.

* RQ3 
 Null hypothesis: The collocation patterns of "very" with other words are independent of the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA). 
Alternative Hypothesis: The collocation patterns of "very" with other words are dependent of the type of text (Spoken: TED, Written: COCA).

Chi-squared test result: The Chi-squared test of independence was applied to assess if the observed differences in the collocation patterns of "very" are not independent of the type of text. The test was statistically significant (χ2=120.4340, df=25, p=0.0).

Interpretation: The Chi-squared statistic of 120.4340with 25 degree of freedom and a p-value of 0.0 suggests that there is statistically significant association between the collocation patterns of "very" and the type of text (TED vs. COCA). The observed differences between actual and expected frequencies are significant at the conventional significance level of 0.05.

Conclusion: The test results indicate that the type of text (TED vs. COCA) does significantly influence the collocation distribution of the word "very" This significant difference suggests that the collocation distribution of  "very"  is differernt between spoken (TED) and written (COCA) texts. Language researchers and educators might consider that these differences imply consistent usage patterns of "very" across different types of texts when analyzing language use or designing language learning materials


* RQ4 
Null Hypothesis 
The frequency of intensifiers is independent of types of text. 
Alternative hypothesis 
The frequency of intensifiers is dependent of types of text.

 
Chi-Squared Test Result:The Chi-squared test of independence was applied to assess if the observed differences in the use of other intensifier patterns are not independent of the type of text. The test was statistically significant (χ² = 83.3710, df = 8, p < 0.001).

Interpretation:The Chi-squared statistic of 83.3710 with 8 degrees of freedom and a p-value less than 0.000 suggests that there is a statistically significant association between the use of other intensifiers and the type of text (TED vs. COCA). The observed differences between actual and expected frequencies are significant at the conventional significance level of 0.05.

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the frequency of intensifiers is dependent on the type of text. This indicates that the usage patterns of intensifiers vary significantly between spoken texts (TED) and written texts (COCA). This finding could be useful for linguists and educators to understand stylistic differences and to tailor language learning materials accordingly.

6. Summary
  
  The research examined four key questions regarding the usage patterns of the word "very" and other intensifiers across spoken (TED) and written (COCA) texts. Findings revealed significant differences in the frequency of "very" between TED and COCA, indicating its varied usage in different contexts. However, the distribution of "very" as an adverb and adjective showed no significant variation between TED and COCA, suggesting consistent usage patterns across spoken and written texts. Collocation patterns of "very" exhibited significant dependency on text type, highlighting distinct linguistic contexts between spoken and written language. Additionally, the study confirmed that the frequency of other intensifiers is significantly influenced by text type, underscoring the need for tailored linguistic analyses and educational approaches across different textual domains.
  
* Limitations and future research directions
  
Limitation: The study lacks research on the frequency of different parts of speech of "very". Additionally, the spoken text consists of speeches, which may not represent all spoken texts, and the written text consists of news articles, which may not represent all written texts.
Future Research directions: There is a need for research on the trends in the use of "very" and "so" among native English speakers in respect of spoken and Written.
