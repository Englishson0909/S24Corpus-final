Sol Yurick the writer whose 1965 novel The Warriors was adapted into a film 14 years later which then became one of the best adapted works ever in video gaming died this weekend He was 88 Yurick s work itself was a loose adaptation of a story told 2300 years before Anabasis which chronicles the journey of Greek mercenaries through hostile territory after the death of their leader Yurick s book and The Warriors both open with a grand council of street gangs convened in the Bronx and the murder of the leader who called for the gathering Cyrus a direct reference to the leader of the Greeks in Anabasis But the stories then diverge significantly Walter Hill the director of The Warriors strove to give a comicbook depiction of the gang s flight from the Bronx back to their Coney Island turf Indeed in Yurick s book the gang s mascot Junior reads a comic book version of each faction was given a name and a costume theme invoking it typified by the iconic Baseball Furies the protagonist Warriors fight in Riverside Park After making their way through rival gangs turf in Manhattan and then back to Coney Island the Warriors defeat the gang responsible for Cyrus death Advertisement The Warriors became a cult hit partly because its exaggerated portrayal of New York City s lawlessness fit with the image of violent crime and decay that blighted the city in the late 1970s A staple of Saturday and Sunday afternoon movie programming on UHF stations the film faded from popular memory until Rockstar resurrected it as a video game 26 years later Sponsored The Warriors released in 2005 for the Xbox and PS2 began with a threeminute recreation of the film s opening sequence shown above Set to the blood pumping guitar and synthesizer of Barry Vorzon s original soundtrack it s one of the best openings a video game has ever had Critics familiar well in a year full of big hits Primarily a brawler with some limited openworld features the game also served as a canonical prologue to the allgang meeting in the Bronx It is playable only on the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox a version for the PSP was released in 2007 That s What They Say Dialect Society chooses its words of the year For this week s edition of That s What They Say University of Michigan Professor Anne Curzan spoke with us from Boston where she was attending the American Dialect Society s annual meeting whose 200 members voted on their Word of the Year Rina Miller So the winner is Anne The winner is hashtag It was a surprise entry It was nominated from the floor I must admit I went in thinking fiscal cliff had this hands down I thought there was no way anything would beat that but fiscal cliff did nt even make the runoff It was hashtag vs marriage equality Rina Why hashtag Anne The argument was that while the word hashtag has been around since 2007 this was the year of the hashtag This was the year that hashtag was everywhere in the Twittersphere and beyond making memes go viral Rina And what were the winners in some of the other categories Anne Marriage equality which was in the runoff for word of the year actually won most likely to succeed And I thought it was a very interesting entry The argument was that as the country has changed its attitudes about marriage equality we ve seen the terminology shift from samesex marriage or gay marriage to marriage equality And people pointed out that when textbooks write this up as a movement it will be about the movement for marriage equality Rina Tell us about some of the other categories Anne One of my favorites most years is the most creative word of the year And there were two terrific candidates this year One is mansplaining which is defined as a man s condescending explanation to a female audience It s designed to capture a certain kind of male behavior It did mean that during the discussion of talking because they could easily be accused of mansplaining every time they tried to say anything even though it was a mixedgender audience Rina That s never happened to me has it to you Anne Anne No never The mansplaining was up against gate lice a description of passengers on an airplane who crowd around the gate waiting to board Rina I love that Anne I loved it too and I particularly liked the singular which is gate louse Rina And who does nt know that Maybe we ve even been a louse Anne And now we have such a great way to talk about it We can say Look at all the gate lice Rina There s also the most unnecessary and the most outrageous categories Those are more serious Anne They are more serious And this year the same phrase won in both categories It Senate candidate Todd Akins And someone pointed out when we were voting for most unnecessary that it came up again under most outrageous on the ballot And someone yelled out It should win both And it did Rina And which word was least likely to succeed Anne That was a tie One of the first I remember It was a tie between YOLO which our listeners over about 25 or 30 may be less familiar with It is an acronym for you only live once It came to prominence this year from the rapper Drake He had a song in which he talked about you only live once YOLO and I think there are a number of young people who got YOLO tattoos which they are going to come to regret because students tell me it is already very unhip YOLO tied with phablet which is apparently a midsized electronic device between a smart phone and a tablet Anne For the most useful we had two combining forms Pocalypse or mageddon which you ll hear people attach to things like snowmaggedon or oilpocalypse to describe a huge oil spill as a hyperbolic way to talk about a catastrophe Rina There had to be something that came out of the elections Anne The election phrase of the year is binders full of women After presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that it instantly became a hashtag and many people have probably seen it circulating online It beat 47 percent which was also up for word of the year So both 47 percent and fiscal cliff did nt win anything A sublime croissant at French Tart in Grant City Staten Island French Tart chef Laurent Chavenet claims to work in the only authentic French cafe and restaurant in Staten Island And he just might be right Opened in 2009 French Tart is one of those hidden gems that food lovers so often hear about in the outer boroughs but so rarely find Baked fresh every morning by Chavenet himself the croissants are a work of art The texture runs from crispy on the outside to soft and airy on the inside According to Chavenet the secret to making a great croissant is in quality ingredients especially the butter and the folding of the dough which Chavenet demonstrates on a napkin While the plain croissant is outstanding the almond croissant is truly worldclass Moist sweet and decadent it s more of a dessert than a breakfast item but go ahead and dig in any time of day After all life is short Eat dessert Colson Patisserie in Park Slope uses two types of flour in its croissants In 1986 pastry chef Hubert Colson first opened his famed pastry shop in Mons Belgium Barely 20 years later Yonatan Israel a French filmmaker searching for structure and opportunity in life opened his own shop as a tribute to his favorite pastry chef And so the Park Slope outpost of Colson Patisserie was born What a gift for pastry lovers in Brooklyn Colson s croissants 245 seem light enough to float above the table and rich enough to melt in your mouth Two types of flour are used in the dough which is then folded six to eight times Eighty croissants are made daily for the pastry shop which is small but welllit by a storefront of large windows Sweet but not candied these croissants taste like a big puff of flaky butter which is just what every New Yorker needs to start off their day As Israel says New York is the to change that You ca nt talk about croissants in New York City without mentioning master pastry chef Laurent Dupal and his Spring St shop CeciCela Since his quaint cafe opened in 1992 Dupal has consistently made some of the flakiest butteriest airiest croissants 2 in the five boroughs Dupal credits fresh ingredients a controlled setting and years of experience for the excellent taste of his croissants hundreds of which are sold a day in the patisserie In fact Dupal compares baking croissants with raising a child Everyone does it differently he says and no matter what you have to adjust to the temperament of the dough which ca nt be too thin or too thick Take some home for the whole family A pack of six frozen croissants costs 7 and can be baked at home YOUR TWO CENTS The croissant at Chock Full o Nuts Cafe 1611 Avenue M Brooklyn is very buttery inside and outside good with a side of

of growth in Portland s performing arts scene The highlight of the Portland Center for Performing Arts grandopening in 1987 was a performance by highwire artists Phillippe Petit and Ann Seward which reflected the thrilling risk the city had taken with the project Steven NehlThe Oregonian Stephanie Mulligan who has been with Artists Repertory Theatre since the mid 1980s knew the Portland theater scene in its younger wilder days There were more trails of glitter than there are today I mean that literally she says I like to think there was a lot more nudity but that might just be a trick of memory These days Portland theater and the city s arts scene in general is nt so stripped down But it is much more glittery if not literally than metaphorically Look around and you ll see it the sparkle of widespread creative activity the shine of technical and artistic quality There s music most definitely in food if you want to extend the definition of the creative culture and perhaps in other areas as well this is Portland s golden age Sure the city s artsy eccentricities can grow ripe for lampooning as the TV spoof Portlandia has proved But such attention would be nonsensical or at least much more embarrassing if there was nt more going on here than adult kickball leagues and mustachegrowing contests if many of the eccentrics were nt really artists A certain shoestring flamboyance as Mulligan s recollections of leaner times suggest is nothing new here But the size scope and solidity of the arts in Portland is something that s grown over the past quarter century That 1987 and 88 marked a pivotal time in Portland arts was clear even then More than a decade of planning and haggling was coming to fruition The idea for a set of new performance spaces began taking place around 1976 due to dissatisfaction with Civic Auditorium satisfying venue In 1981 voters passed a 19 million bond issue Next came political squabbles cost overruns from 25 million to 41 million by the time it opened and a scramble to find money for operating costs But eventually the Civic was joined by the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall a refurbished 1928 movie palace and a new multiuse building next door Ten or 20 years from now few will remember all the effort dreaming planning and yes the bickering mistakes and accusations that marked the creation of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts The Oregonian s Joan Laatz wrote in August 1987 when the multiuse New Theater Building now named Antoinette Hatfield Hall opened Meanwhile city officials had been looking for an anchor tenant to take up residence in the center s the 900seat space now known as the Newmark Theatre A study commissioned by the Fred Meyer Trust concluded that not even the city s top existing theater company Portland organizationally Cynthia Fuhrman a veteran theater marketing exec recalls that Portland was the largest city in the country that did nt have a company in the League of Resident Theatres the association of major regional theaters After being courted on and off for years Ashland s Oregon Shakespeare Festival signed on and its new satellite operation dubbed Portland Center Stage stepped into the lights in Nov 1988 After seeing the new company in the new building Time magazine said that Portland at last could stake a claim to sophistication and social significance More so than social stature the goal was for the PCPA to both bring more touring talents to town and give local troupes a comfortable home that would help them grow their audiences and for PCS to provide a model of quality stability and professionalism that might lift the community as a whole The fear was that higher production costs in the new facilities would make things tougher for most local arts companies and that the venerable OSF There was so much buzz about OSF coming up recalls Beth Harper who d soon launch what s now called Portland Actors Conservatory I was in a show at New Rose and everyone felt like The big guys are coming and we ve never got that kind of attention One of the things that still rings true Harper adds is the big boys are still the big boys and the small ones are still the small ones Though perhaps not Yes Center Stage which split from OSF to become an independent company in 1994 remains atop the theatrical food chain What were the largest or most active homegrown companies back in the late 80s Portland Rep New Rose Storefront Portland Civic Theater long ago folded As Mulligan recalls It took about five years for the dust to settle unfortunately the dust was some fine companies And as it did then the stage a few shows a year in rented or makeshift spaces Numerous factors are involved not just the anchoring effects of PCPA and PCS but the theater scene now has a broader range of companies Artists Repertory Theatre once a scrappy little operation in rented space at the downtown YWCA grew to become the city s No 2 company with a 24 million budget and its own twinauditorium home Down the scale in budget but punching above their weight artistically Third Rail Rep Portland Playhouse and Profile Theatre form a strong middle tier However persistent the funding challenges of the dance world a similar vertical growth if you will can be found In the late 80s Portland had both Ballet Oregon and Pacific Ballet Theatre for contemporary dance Portland State University housed a concert series for touring groups and a topnotch resident company Now Oregon Ballet Theatre the result of a merger of the aforementioned ballet troupes survives White Bird does concert presenting at Polaris Dance Theatre each have performance spaces and expanding reputations I think the arts scene was like a young teenager then and has grown up a lot says Regional Arts amp Culture Council executive director Eloise Damrosch who moved to Portland in 87 Our reputation as a place to visit has really skyrocketed I m struck when I open up the AampE and see all the options There s a lot more happening and such a range Quantity is nt the only thing that s changed Back then there was this grittier shoestring quality that imbued almost every company Mulligan says The dedication to art was inspiring But when I look back at that earlier renaissance of the 80s the truth was the talent pool of the city needed to step up Jim Fullan who has worked in marketing at Portland Opera and the Oregon Symphony says the city has developed a radically different sense of our place such an inferiority complex regarding Seattle San Francisco and Los Angeles that it distrusted artistic ambition The public would punish you for getting too big for your britches The prevailing attitude was It s good enough for us We like it Now that s totally gone It s almost the opposite If you re not aspiring to be worldclass you re not on the boat The arts in tandem with food beer and wine have raised us up The building of the PCPA has nt solved all of the performancespace issues for local companies there s a big problematic gap between the 900seat Newmark and the Schnitzer and Keller which seat close to 3000 And it s notable that Center Stage had to move to a home of its own a renovated 19thcentury armory in the Pearl District to begin fulfilling its potential as a truly vibrant hub for the theater scene But those two big moves have over time proved other developments have helped shape the Portland of today Some observers point to the fundraising success of John and Lucy Buchanan at the Portland Art Museum 1994 to 2005 They actually made a case that a great city needs great art says BodyVox cofounder Jamey Hampton And that put a gauntlet down Leadership changes in 2003 at Portland Opera Oregon Ballet Theatre and the Oregon Symphony also marked a crucial transition Hampton points to Tom Manley president of Pacific Northwest College of Art as probably the best leader of an arts organization the city has PNCA has grown to be a leading creative and economic force in the Pearl District and it s in the process of remaking how that neighborhood looks It s not splashy like when Pink Martini plays New Year s Eve at the Schnitz It s quiet but it s really foundational Through it all the essential challenges remain much the same make good work expand audiences cultivate donors business model away from a focus on bigmoney patrons and toward building longterm relationships with supporters of all sorts nurturing them along the path from firsttime ticket buyer to subscriber to contributor and so on Others point out that the city is awash in heavily subsidized art but that the artists themselves provide the subsidy comes from the artists themselves in the form of the second jobs lack of health care or multiple roommates that allow them to subsist as artists All together what s changed and what s stayed the same add up to an arts scene that while still facing major challenges has grown bigger wider and better integrated into the world around it I do nt think it happens in isolation Fuhrman says It s about the growth of the city as a whole Ask Ars Does Facebook autodelete content after a certain period of time Ars reader wants to create a page for an ancestor but worries about losing content In 1998 Ask Ars was an early feature of the newly launched Ars Technica Now as then it s all about your questions and our community s answers We occasionally dig into our question bag provide our own take then tap the wisdom of our readers To submit your own question see our helpful tips page I ask because I want to use Facebook to create a historical timeline about an ancestor in my family so people can learn more about their heritage I have Googled my question several times and all answers are confusing and mixed some say everything stays on a FB page until you clean it off and others say Facebook deletes status updates and photos monthly This is an interesting way to use Facebook to create a page for someone who is not existed Typically the question is the other way around what to do with someone s existing Facebook account after they pass away And given the level of confusion constantly floating around about Facebook s data retention policies it s no surprise that it might be hard to pinpoint exactly when if ever information gets deleted from the social network We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others including those described above Typically information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted For certain categories of data we may also tell you about specific data retention practices Just to be sure we reached out to Facebook to confirm this is indeed the policy for the above use case The company confirmed that as long as you have not deleted the content yourself or in the case of a message between two people both people have not deleted it the content should stay online indefinitely to keep in mind about this policy If you ever do want to delete the content you should know that it s not likely to disappear instantly As you may remember we followed a thread for several years over how fast photos are deleted from Facebook s servers once you delete them from the site as of late 2012 we verified that photos indeed appear to be removed within 30 days of deletion our tests showed they were actually removed much faster It s not just about photos though As outlined in the same Data Use Policy referenced above there are major differences between deactivating an account versus deleting an account should you choose to eventually remove the account you created for your ancestor Many Facebook users mistakenly think that deactivating their accounts equals deletion but that is not so Deactivating your account puts your account on hold Other users will no longer see your timeline but we do not delete any of your information Deactivating an account is the because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future You can deactivate your account on your account settings page Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated So when you deactivate your ancestor s account it s not really going anywhere The data is still there lurking somewhere on Facebook s servers even if the friends of that account can no longer see it Deletion however is another matter When you delete an account it is permanently deleted from Facebook It typically takes about one month to delete an account but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it Certain information is needed to provide you with services so we only delete this information after you delete your account Some of the things you do on Facebook are group or sending someone a message where your friend may still have a message you sent even after you delete your account That information remains after you delete your account I often see Facebook users confusing these two things They usually become alarmed when they ve deactivated an account only to have all the old information show up again when they go to register a new account But if you actually go through with a real deletion the information should nt be there past 90 days and hopefully it will be gone sooner NEW YORK An associate of a notorious Russian arms dealer was arrested in Australia and charged with conspiring to buy planes so that weapons could be transported to the world s bloodiest conflicts a US prosecutor announced Thursday Syrianborn American Richard Ammar Chichakli was arrested Wednesday at the request of US authorities on charges that he conspired with Russian arms merchant Viktor Bout and others to try to buy the planes from two US companies Sukree Sukplang Reuters file Suspected Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout speaks to the media after arriving at a Bangkok criminal court August 20 2010 ahead of an expected appeal court verdict on whether to extradite him to the US His arrest was first confirmed by the Australian Fairfax Media news organization which reported Thursday that he was arrested in Melbourne after applying for a post in the government Protective Service Office a law enforcement agency The news service reported that he said nothing during a Thursday hearing at the Melbourne Magistrates Court A lawyer for Chichakli Almustafa Chichakli was held pending the processing of a US extradition request Victoria state police spokeswoman Jessica Rosewarne confirmed Chichakli was caught after applying for the government post He was identified as a person of interest through routine background checks as part of the application process she said He had not been offered employment with Victoria police or started any training US Attorney Preet Bharara the chief federal prosecutor in New York said Chichakli consorted with the world s most notorious arms trafficker in the purchase of aircraft that would be used to transport weapons to some of the world s bloodiest conflict zones in violation of international sanctions Michele M Leonhart administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the international law enforcement community has long recognized Chichakli as a key criminal facilitator in Bout s global weapons trafficking regime His arrest means the world is safer and more secure she said in a release Merchant of Death Bout is a former his 1990sera notoriety for running a fleet of aging Sovietera cargo planes to conflictridden hotspots in Africa He also inspired the arms dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film Lord of War An indictment against Chichakli in US District Court in Manhattan and other court documents accuse Chichakli of working as a close associate of Bout since at least the mid1990s to assemble a fleet of cargo planes capable of shipping weapons and military equipment to various parts of the world including Africa South America and the Middle East Prosecutors say the arms have helped fuel conflicts and support regimes in Afghanistan Angola The Democratic Republic of the Congo Liberia Rwanda Sierra Leone and Sudan Over the years Chichakli has weaved a colorful biography of his past but often repudiated his comments under the glare of law enforcement scrutiny He has claimed to have befriended a young Osama bin Laden during college days at Riyadh University in Saudi Arabia He also claimed a stint in the US Army Gulf War The indictment accuses Chichakli and Bout of violating sanctions by arranging to buy two Boeing aircraft from US companies in 2007 It says they electronically transferred more than 17 million through banks in New York and into bank accounts in the US though the money was blocked by the US Department of the Treasury before it reached the aviation companies accounts The Treasury Department had imposed an asset freeze against Chichakli in April 2005 as part of larger financial sanctions aimed at the Bout network s dealings with the dictatorial regime of Liberian President Charles Taylor The department called Chichakli who once ran a small conglomerate of Texasbased businesses from a Dallas suburb Bout s USbased chief financial officer If convicted Chichakli could face up to 20 years in prison on each of nine counts including conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act money laundering conspiracy wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud IRELAND S Olympic bronze medallist Michael Conlan and reigning European champion Andrew Selby from Wales resume one of amateur boxing s most compelling rivalries when the World Series of Boxing heads to Bethnal Green s historic York Hall tomorrow Conlan will be representing the USA Knockouts franchise in the team competition while Selby intends to do his bit to extend the GB Lionhearts unbeaten home record but the real allure of the contest lies in the simple notion of repeat or revenge Selby beat Conlan by a single point in a hotly contested flyweight quarterfinal in the World Championships in Baku in 2011 the Welshman going on to reach the final where he lost an equally slim verdict to Misha Aloian of Russia I would nt say there is bad blood between us but there is certainly some tension because he won our last fight by a point and I thought I had done enough to win the 21yearold Conlan told the Press Association The pair narrowly missed the chance of a return match beaten in the quarterfinal by Cuba s brilliant Robeisy Ramirez Carrazana Carrazana went on to clearly beat Conlan in the last four consigning the Irishman to a bronze medal which saw him return home to a hero s welcome and his own mural on the corner of his home street in west Belfast Thursday s bout will be the first time Conlan has fought since his defeat to the Cuban It has been a very enjoyable time since the Olympics but I would nt say it has affected my training very much Conlan said I have been in the gym for the last 12 weeks and the only difference is I get recognised more which the mural at the bottom of my street probably helps It was very unexpected and a great honour for me While Selby was bitterly disappointed to return home from the Olympics without a medal he remains one of the best 52kg fighters in the business having long since shrugged off the chronic weight problems that once a pasty this week for the first time in ages Selby said There was a time when I could nt eat for two days before a bout and had to spend the whole time running and skipping to get the weight off It definitely affected my performances but I ve got over it now and I feel so much stronger and sharper I ca nt wait to get back in the ring with Michael It s going to be a very tough fight I know he s going to be wanting revenge Despite its rather contrived franchise system which will see two of Conlan s Ireland teammates John Joe Nevin and Joe Ward lining up for the opposite side the WSB is clearly made for the likes of Conlan and Selby intent on keeping the lure of pros at bay Conlan says he is prepared to commit to Rio 2016 He said It s a long way away but I definitely want to win a The WSB gives a great incentive not to go pro because you get paid for having top fights It makes you wonder whether it is really worth turning over There s not so much money in the pros these days unless you re a superstar Selby will also stay amateur at least up to next year s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow when he will aim to dispel the dismal memory of his weightdrained second round defeat to Haroon Khan in Delhi I ve got unfinished business with the Commonwealths and the fact it s in Glasgow makes it something great to aim for Selby said I want to go there and get a gold and then it will be time for me to sit down and think about Rio At least for the time being the rivalry between two of the world s best amateur flyweight

health conditions But researchers are still working to unravel the mystery about how having an active social life or the lack of one can influence physical health Findings from two related studies recently presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology offer new insights into how loneliness can weaken the immune system increase sensitivity to physical pain and contribute to inflammation in the body One study looked at overweight but otherwise healthy middleaged adults while the second evaluated breast cancer survivors In both studies participants completed stress tests provided blood samples and had their social lives evaluated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale The loneliest of the otherwise healthy participants had more markers of inflammation when tasked with a stressful activity like speaking in front of others or doing math The lonelier breast cancer survivors in addition to increased inflammation experienced more pain which tends to be triggered by stress can also be used a measure of immune response Here those who scored higher for loneliness showed more signs of herpes reactivation Researchers say the results suggest that being lonely can cause people to experience daily life as more stressful which may cause chronic stress and in turn disrupt the immune system The findings related to breast cancer survivors reminded me of

Ohlone Indians Uncover the mysteries of Mission Dolores ancient cemetery CyArk a nonprofit digital scanning company based in Oakland is creating the digital El Camino Real documenting some of the oldest buildings and historic sites in California LISTEN Like Interstate 101 Some people think the Camino Real means the Royal Road of Jesus in California says Andrew Galvan curator of Mission Dolores San Francisco No It was the King s Highway the King of Spain s highway Mission Dolores founded in 1776 is the oldest surviving structure in San Francisco and Real to be scanned and documented by CyArk If you step out the front door of Mission Dolores you are on the El Camino Real says Andrew It was a public road like Interstate 101 All the California Missions are connected Wherever you got on it the road led you to the Viceroy s Palace in Mexico City CyArk s Laser Scanning MissionCyArk has digitally preserved over 70 sites around the world from Pompeii in Italy to Tikal in Guatemala We use a 3 D laser scanner that sends out a pulsed laser beam and captures billions of points of these structures at a rate of about 100000 points a second explains Elizabeth Lee who directs operations at CyArk These sites are at risk endangered due to everyday exposure to the elements vandalism war urbanization poorly managed tourism catastrophic events and general neglect The non profit organization

entertainment and crime forensics It was right at the time that the Bamiyam Buddhas were blown up by the Taliban remembers Barbara Kacyra There was no 3 dimensional documentation of them We said How can we use this technology to help architects archaeologists and preservationists get better tools than tape measures and a clip boards and a pencils to go in and document these heritage sites Hidden Mural Revealed Historic carved altarpiece from Mexico installed in front of mural painted by Indians Sometimes new things are revealed during the scanning process At Mission Dolores CyArk worked hard to get behind the very ornately carved reredos a false wall in back of the altar that was made in Mexico and shipped to the Mission by boat in 1796 For more than 200 years the reredos has obscured a mural that was painted by the Indians when the mission a two foot space behind the frame where the statues are today says Andrew Very few have ever been able to see what s behind Using fiber optics they ll be able to get a little pin wheel and be able to photograph Then you ll be able to click on say Saint Joachim with your smart phone and boom You ll be able to see behind floor to ceiling the mural that the Indians painted here at Mission Dolores It s not about the sites themselves says Barbara Kacyra It s really about the stories Whether it was Manzanar or Angor Wat or Pompeii It s about the humanness of these sites The History of San Francisco There are almost 6000 Indians buried in the Mission Dolores cemetery relates Andy Galvan whose relationship to the Mission is much more than Museum Curator Andrew is an Ohlone Indian whose ancestors were some of the first people baptized married and buried at the Mission Dolores the gravemarkers you re going to read the history of San Francisco he says The 21 California missions are cultural heritage sites These are our monuments The Digital El Camino Real is about digitally imagining about preservation But it s also about interpretation It s about what happened at the California Missions Andy Galvan s Ohlone Indian ancestors are buried in the cemetery at Mission Dolores MORE POSTS ABOUT The Making Of was part of a

MPAA as a particularly dronehappy group but new documents reveal that the actively lobbying the US government for UAV drone use in domestic space No they are nt building an army to track down pirates they just want filmmakers to be able to shoot with them Howard Gantman a spokesman for the MPAA argues that drones are safer cheaper and easier to use for aerial shots than helicopters or cranes and can be super useful for particularly crazy shots Sure some filmmakers are already using unmanned aerial vehicles for filming but the legality of the issue is something of a grey area The MPAA is pushing the FAA for fullon allowance of the practice so it can really takeoff so to speak The main argument against this is that widespread commercial drone use could lead to all kinds of domestic spying a privilege the government might like to are already working on laws to prevent exactly the sort of drone use the MPAA is lobbying for Commercial drone use is a big can of worms inside and outside of the movie industry Currently the FAA plans on starting to issue private drone licences by 2015 but it still has to work out the details of who should be allowed to get them If the MPAA has anything to say about it filmmakers will definitely be on that list While they re at it maybe they could put in a good word for fastfood delivery drones too The Hill via Fast Company Just because there is a picture of a Predator or similar in the story does nt mean that the studios want military drones These beasts are not necessarily cheap nor efficient for what they want Though they Do have

mistakenly arrested an autistic teenage girl for being drunk Melissa Jones 17 was charged with being drunk and disorderly despite suffering with communication problems as part of her condition Merseyside police has referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC The force said it would also look into the handing of the case A spokesman said it would be reviewing the case to see if there are any lessons to be learned College student Melissa who was 16 at the time spent the night in DNA taken after she intervened in a brawl in which she ended up being assaulted Police issued Melissa with a fixed penalty notice but she appealed against it and appeared before court in November last year where she was formally charged with being drunk and disorderly A trial was due to be held next month but Melissa was told last week that the CPS were dropping the case due to insufficient evidence Her mum Christine Evans 49 told the ECHO She should never have been arrested in the first place let alone charged with drunk and disorderly She was upset after being beaten up so when the police arrested her she became hysterical because she knew she had nt done anything wrong Melissa had been to a shop with friends near her home in Wavertree shortly before midnight on June 16 last year to buy soft drinks A drunken woman entered the shop in Smithdown Road and became aggressive when her friends were attacked when they tried to intervene Both girls were stamped on and suffered severe bruising Christine said This woman had been kicking another girl in the head Melissa thought she was going to kill her so she jumped in and the woman turned on her I ran to the shop and told the police Melissa had nt touched a drop she s a good girl but her autism means she ca nt communicate the way we do Christine said Melissa s ordeal with the police and going to court had affected her daughter so badly she has needed counselling ever since She added Melissa has been through hell for the last six months she s even tried to kill herself over this A Merseyside Police spokesman said A 16 yearold girl was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly following a

Welsh operations Married dadoftwo and keen golfer Alastair is one of the longestserving newspaper editors in the country His North America s population in the 19th century spread from east to west driven in the main by farming And where farmers planted themselves so grew a demand for farm credit and eastern bankers followed them Drought and crop failure repeatedly parched farmers credit and their bankers and when fresh credit got tough to get the farmers turned to government for help Here farm economics and politics led to the 1920s Canadian Farm Loan Board created to offer mortgages to respond to a perceived lack of credit for Western farmers The Farm Credit Corporation replaced the board in 1959 with a broader mandate that included consulting services for farmers The former board operated mostly on a forprofit basis but FCC s lending rate was set at 5 well below profitability amounting to an interest rate subsidy to farmers By the 1970s as the corporation s losses mounted interest rates were set at the cost of funds plus 125 Farm Credit Corporation Act The new Act allowed FCC to finance farmrelated enterprises and bigger farms It did not limit FCCs activities to filling gaps left by the private sector These steps the shift from forprofit to subsidized farm credit and the expansion to areas where there was no clear market failure signaled departure from FCC s original creditgap mandate Changes in 2001 allowed FCC to offer more of financial and business management services and widened FCC s potential clientele to include more farmrelated businesses including those not farmerowned And FCC has seen tremendous growth Its share of farm debt grew from about 14 in 1992 to 29 by the end of 2011 FCC s share of farm debt stands against that of all chartered banks which hold 36 and all credit unions which hold another 16 FCC has expanded its activities enlarged its capital base to do so and built market in a field where the private sector is historically competitive FCC s success owes much to its government and it borrows directly from the federal government on terms that reflect Ottawa s credit quality It does not face the same regulatory capital requirements as other financial institutions and pays no corporate income tax And FCC s loan offerings and terms are different from others FCC loans tend to have long amortization periods higher loantovalue ratios and the corporation stands at least as ready as others to lend against supply management dairy and poultry farm quotas and to offer interestonly loans It finances farmers who sign Ontario green energy supply contacts Other offerings seem likely to encourage debt and inflate farm asset values The Capacity Builder Loan to finance quota purchases or livestock with an option to capitalize interest in turn deeply investing FCC and federal taxpayers in maintaining the farm quota system None of these is inherently inappropriate but they are risky in much the same way that socalled subprime mortgage lending is risky Loans characterized by low down payments early accumulations of interest due or involve balloon or variable future payments have a higher default rate than more traditional loans Now lending under such risky conditions carries an interest rate premium For small business lending a typical risk premium might be 300 basis points above prime Of course FCC does not charge such a premium and unsurprisingly its relatively risky loan books carry an impairment ratio that exceeds its competitors And risks have been growing alongside farm indebtedness as a percent of net income see graph The implications are simple but serious FCC competes with privatesector lenders in offering financing services to farmers and others its market share has been growing without a regulatory capital constraint and farm lending has grown relative to farm income an indicator of rising risk in the sector The increased financial risks also appear on the asset side of farms balance sheets The values of farms and buildings and farm quota values have shown effervescent increases in recent years total assets see graph And FCC s lending has grown even faster than farm asset values Of course credit tends to drive asset prices and increases tend to be followed by sharp revaluations Recent farm debt growth coupled with FCC s aggressive strategies warrants closer examination by regulators and taxpayers The potential impacts are not only related to FCC Its market pressure pushes private lenders to adjust their own lending standards to remain competitive Canadian regulators need to monitor the situation more closely FCC as is the case for the BDC and EDC is not formally subject to a prudential regulator As a starting place FCC should be

60 What follows is the third of five excerpts from a newly released ebook The Canadian Forces in 2025 Problems and Prospects The publication was commissioned by the Strategic Studies Working Group a partnership between the Canadian International Council and the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute In today s installment James Fergusson looks at our AirForce presence in the Arctic The federal government has tasked the Canadian Forces with monitoring controlling and enforcing Canadian laws and regulations over its Arctic territory and adjacent waters In so doing the government through its 2008 Canada First Defence Strategy and National Shipbuilding Strategy has focused particular attention on the Royal Canadian Navy RCN The RCN and Coast Guard will play a major role in enforcing national laws and regulations on fishing the environment shipping and smuggling However the major burden will fall on the Royal Canadian Air Force Today the RCAF is a southern overseas Air Force that goes North only when necessary Only four Twin Otter aircraft are permanently deployed to the North at Yellowknife with Joint Task Force North Headquarters They undertake a variety of missions including search and rescue SAR A small number of CF18 fighters deployed at Cold Lake and Bagotville and assigned to NORAD are dedicated to the airsovereignty mission Their primary use continues to be to intercept Russian bombers on training missions as they approach Canadian air space Four forward operating locations FOLs colocated with civilian airports in Yellowknife Inuvik Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet were developed in the 1980s for the dispersal of CF18s to the North In addition the Aurora surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft undertake regular Arctic patrols To monitor Canadian and North American air space in the North the North Warning System NWS replaced NORAD s Distant Early Warning radar line in the 1980s It primarily consists of automated the Northwest Passage Finally the RCAF operates Canadian Forces Station Alert on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island The station performs a signals intelligence function and supports SAR It is projected that over the next decade there will be an exponential increase in shipping and resource exploitation activity in the Arctic If so the RCAF will be required to monitor Canada s Arctic on a daily basis More activity also means an increase in search and rescue demands As such the RCAF will have no choice but to shift resources to the North on a permanent basis To meet this demand the existing FOLs likely will become permanent bases for forward deployed surveillance and reconnaissance and SAR aircraft The Aurora or possibly future unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs will play a vital role in monitoring traffic over this expansive area Though UAVs can be operated from bases in the south through satellite links they will still need to be maintained at their bases in the North Being cued by the will provide tracking of shipping and fishing vessels the identification of targets of interest and direction of RCN or Coast Guard vessels for interception purposes Permanently deployed SAR aircraft and helicopters will be necessary to provide rapid response to accidents in the North In addition helicopters also will potentially provide a rapid response interception capability There is also a slight possibility that the CF18 or its replacement will need to be permanently deployed to the North However the likelihood that significant military threats will emerge in the Arctic is very low especially as a function of the harsh environment Finally the North Warning System will likely be expanded northward as part of its future modernization with all the attendant costs of building new sites Currently the RCAF is developing a northern plan to meet future demand Regardless of the details the costs will be significant Building and staffing permanent bases will be expensive although some costs may be offset by other government departments and agencies in response to increased civilian no need to acquire a dedicated Arctic aircraft The current and planned inventory of multirole aircraft will be able to meet this requirement That will reduce some costs However aircraft and personnel deployed to the North on a permanent basis will impact the ability of the RCAF to meet its other demands Costs related to the retention and recruitment of personnel also will be significant Canadians may have an emotional attachment to the North but this does not necessarily mean that RCAF personnel and their families will look forward to being posted there for several years In order to meet these costs the key issue for the RCAF is whether government will be willing to provide the necessary funding If not the RCAF will be strained to the breaking point which will cascade throughout the organization as it confronts other significant investment demands on its equipment and personnel National Post James Fergusson is a Research Fellow with the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute From Richard III to Johnny Rotten The changing face of evil Add to When Johnny Lydon then known as Johnny Rotten took the microphone in front of the Sex Pistols in the late 1970s he projected a fantastic malevolence Skinny hunched wideeyed a man angerobsessed He also began to affect a strange accent a hyperenunciation with trilled r s as in Rrright now It was clearly his own Cockney tinged with something else a parody of something aristocratic Lydon has said in interviews and in his autobiography that this stage persona was partly inspired by Laurence Olivier s performance of Richard III in his 1955 film based on the Shakespeare play And indeed that is the image the twisted poetic man with murder on his mind that we have long had imprinted on us an image not just of this particular king but of English kings in general It was a creation of Shakespeare and of Sex Pistols but by Rowan Atkinson in the early Blackadder episodes and even to a certain extent by Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a slender yet savage Henry VIII in The Tudors It informed Heath Ledger s nastily disfigured Joker character Disfigurement or simple ugliness is key to the persona in all its iterations Shakespeare called the king a hunchback we now know he had severe scoliosis He was using a crude and ancient trick of storytelling Villains like monsters are ugly They bear some deformity that evinces their evil The monster Grendel Beowulf s nemesis is an unnatural birth larger than a man his skin covered in a horny iron substance Rumpelstiltskin the evil imp is the opposite a dwarf Witches and wicked stepmothers have warts and curved noses throughout fairy tales The tradition continues through modern science fiction where alien enemies are usually reptilian or masked like Darth Vader what horrible visage is the dark lord protecting from sight Rotten was using to command attention Ugliness is clever rebellious angry His ugliness heralded revolution And Shakespeare s Richard III is similarly complex His resentment about his deformity motivates him Some of the most frightening lines about physical ugliness in English literature come out of his mouth Deformed unfinish d sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Later Queen Margaret describes him as a poisonous bunchback d toad He calls her in return a hateful wither d hag Shakespeare did not fear causing offence It is hard for anyone with a disability or deformity to read those lines I have a minor one myself funny hands and remember being moved as a teenager reading this play by the horror of the dogs as the lame man passes by In modern times interpreters of Shakespeare s character A famous Royal Shakespeare Company show from 1984 had actor Richard Sher playing the king in crutches barely able to walk other companies have used actors with real disabilities to play the king including at least one in a wheelchair The idea with every new version of the play is to add to the character s complexity to make him more than a mere psycho By the 19th century the sentimental archetype of the deformed antihero had shifted to a more benevolent one Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame is an object of sympathy rather than loathing a simple victim rather than a complex tyrant This is now a convention we are familiar with too in theatre in particular The Phantom of the Opera is also about a disfigured face that needs love Even in recent science fiction and fantasy attempts have been made to break negative expectations of abnormallooking characters Tyrion Lannister the manipulative genius of Game of Thrones is a sympathetic dwarf and as has become a sex symbol The South African scifi film District 9 created a slave race of slimy aliens they have tentacles on their faces and are rudely called Prawns who are the most sympathetic and secretly intelligent characters in the story The idea in modern representations is that we the audience all feel abnormal in some way and are going to identify with the mocked and shunned far more than with the powerful This idea of individualism is a recent one a product of the Enlightenment and Romanticism Shakespeare s textured and interesting Richard III though is part of the beginning of that transformation for disfigured characters in literary history from monsters to charming victims or even stoic heroes Richard like Johnny Rotten is dissatisfied with idle pleasures and determined to be a villain and an amusing and charming villain he is This was around 1592 75 years before Milton s attractively tortured Satan in Paradise Lost became a model for sexy villains found evidence that the real Richard III was not only actually deformed but that his life of battle was truly an ugly one The skeleton found under a parking lot in Leicester showed the results of bound wrists an axe or sword blow to the head a sword through the buttocks and other unnamed humiliation wounds probably inflicted after death This king was torn apart by a mob of soldiers his body publicly defiled and then thrown into an unmarked grave The world of violence these guys lived in was ruthless from birth One ca nt really imagine a blameless moral king coming out of this culture Plantagenets Tudors Sopranos all fundamentally depraved family sagas We need a scary character a face to embody the blood thirst of the time Creepily a computer reconstruction of Richard III s face based on the skull recently dug up bears a very slight resemblance to the young Laurence Oliviers Incompatible with life Mother s account of her difficult decision to request a lateterm abortion sheds light on liveborn debate One mother s account of her difficult decision to request a rare lateterm abortion Twentyone weeks into her second pregnancy when the fetus was diagnosed with a rare bone disease Carol determined she had two options Miscarry the baby naturally and deliver a child with a shattered skeleton that would live for a matter of seconds or request a rare lateterm abortion I found out when I was five months pregnant and by the time you re five months pregnant you re all in said Carol not her real name There s no great outcome in these situations Babies without lungs kidneys spines bones or brains These are the rare incompatible with life conditions that clinicians say prompt most if not all of Canada s contentious live born abortions According to Statistics and 2009 But while three MPs drafted a Jan 23 letter to the RCMP citing these live born abortions as evidence of premeditated homicide in Canadian hospitals clinicians and veterans of the procedure maintain that in Canada the only fetuses terminated in latestage abortions are those whose fates are already sealed Carol s fetus was killed by the procedure but it was virtually identical to those that result in live births I want people to understand what these women have been through before they start accusing the doctors who helped them of being murderers said Carol In 2010 537 Canadian women underwent abortions after 21 weeks of pregnancy not including Quebec According to Wendy Norman a clinical professor at the University of British Columbia almost everyone in those cases has some different anomaly Some have fetal anencephaly a condition in which the fetus fails to develop a brain Others fail to develop kidneys a condition known as Potter Many times said Dr Norman the specific defect is so rare that it does not even have a proper medical name After an ultrasound at 21 weeks Carol s fetus was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta a genetic disorder that results in severe bone fragility Less severe versions of the condition are survivable although they result in physical deformities into adulthood Carol s fetus however had one of the most extreme cases If the baby was naturally stillborn said Carol she would have needed to select a name learn the child s gender and make funeral arrangements Carol requested a latestage abortion adding that the procedure was never broached by medical staff and even finding a physician qualified to perform it was a challenge They re not offering these things up It was nt even presented as an option she said If anything she said hospital staff made sure to explain why some women will carry a known stillborn to birth Blogs and online pregnancy forums abound with testimonials from women who carried their children to term with full knowledge that they would not live more than a matter of minutes I savored every kick and turn she made inside my growing belly I savored every kick and turn she made inside my growing belly wrote one woman of her decision to carry a fetus with fetal anencephaly to term Wrote another woman whose fetus was diagnosed with Potter s Syndrome I chose to carry to term and made it to 37 12 weeks when we had a Csection He lived just under three hours the happiest and saddest hours of my life Speaking to the Post in November Dr Douglas Black president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists speculated that similar sentiments may underlie the 491 liveborn abortions between 2000 and 2009 As hospitals will routinely administer a lethal injection to a fetus prior to a laterstage abortion Dr Black guessed that any aborted due to the private choice of a mother Such fetuses are subsequently allowed to pass away depending on what the circumstances are sometimes in their mom s arms he said For Carol there were physical risks of carrying the fetus to term over another four months but she said it was also a psychological decision The idea of having the pain of childbirth compounded by the really emotional trauma of losing a child it was a lot to take on I do nt think I would have been able to think about having more babies subsequently she said She has since given birth to a second child in a

prevention of the eye condition from which 80 of Asians suffer Myopia is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide and currently there is no cure according to a study published in the journal Nature Genetics The study was led by professor Chris Hammond from the department of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King s College London Researchers analysed the genetic and refractive error data of over 45000 people from 32 different studies The new genes include those which function in brain and eye tissue signalling the structure of the eye and eye development It was

NRO account of Bangladeshi nationals without its prior approval it has been decided that henceforth banks would be permitted to open NRO account of individuals of Bangladesh nationality without the approval of the Reserve Bank it said in a notification The permission is granted subject to the conditions the bank should satisfy itself that the individual holds a valid visa and valid residential permit The RBI said banks should put in place a system of quarterly reporting whereby each branch of the bank shall maintain a record of the bank accounts opened by individuals of Bangladesh nationality and details of such account shall be forwarded to their head office The head office of the concerned bank shall furnish details of such accounts containing the name date of arrival in India passport number residential permit reference name of the Foreigner Registration Office the bank branch where the account is maintained on quarterly basis to the Ministry of Home Affairs However opening of accounts by entities of Bangladesh ownership shall continue to require approval of RBI it added further As per the extant guidelines opening of NonResident Ordinary Rupee NRO accounts by

in their heart of hearts are convinced their drooling pet is the canine version of Einstein only with better grooming GUS RUELAS PURINA THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARCHIVES Cochiti a sixyearold whippet competes in a diving dog competition A new book argues dogs are smarter than you think CP Stray dogs in Moscow are smart enough to use public transport a fact accepted by Muscovites who do nt crowd them on the subway The thing is they re right dogs are geniuses In this wellresearched highly readable book author Brian Hare a scientist who is becoming known throughout the world as that dog guy has laid out a compelling argument for the unique genius of man s best friend It s not that your dog has the skill to paint a masterpiece or compose a a special kind of intelligence that gives them more in common with human infants than their wolf ancestors Written with his coresearcher and wife Vanessa Woods The Genius of Dogs is the first book to provide a complete look at the new world of dog cognition which has been playfully dubbed dognition For hundreds of years researchers largely overlooked the millions of domesticated dogs that serve as pets or service animals comfortably working alongside humans But in the last 10 years there has been something of a revolution in the study of canine intelligence and Hare has been the scientist leading the charge We have learned more about how dogs think in the past decade than we have in the previous century Hare writes This book is about how cognitive science has come to understand the genius of dogs through experimental games using nothing much more hightech than toys cups balls and anything else lying around the garage An evolutionary anthropologist Centre Most importantly he s a dog lover And thankfully he s not a blowhard In journalism there s a warning When dealing with experts beware the expertise The concern is when academics write books they tend to bash readers over the head with scientific jargon in an effort to ensure everyone understands just how clever they are Thankfully Hare aided by his journalist wife has crafted a gamechanging book that while faithfully documenting complex research is clear jargonfree and relies on a simple narrative style to deliver a truly gripping read What does Hare mean when he says dogs are geniuses Well he s mostly referring to their ability to spontaneously make inferences to solve problems by reading human gestures Hare recalls his time working at Emory University under a professor named Mike Tomasello who was trying to figure out what makes us human One day Mike was lamenting that only humans understand communicative intentions which allow pointing At that moment the author had a flash of insight I think my dog can do it he blurted And through a series of experiments in his parents garage with their dog Oreo he proved just that It turns out that dogs have a unique ability to follow human gestures such as pointing to locate a food reward hidden under one of a series of plastic cups In fact dogs are at the top of the class compared with wolves and chimps and other wild animals In short Hare writes Mike and I concluded that dogs have communicative skills that are amazingly similar to those of infants The longstanding belief is that domesticated dogs are less intelligent than wild animals such as wolves and foxes yet the central point of The Genius of Dogs is that the opposite is true human contact has actually increased the genius of the species With a nod to Darwin Hare says A friendly wild dog one that was willing to tolerate proximity to humans was favoured with a great reward a new food supply known as garbage Hare also dispels the myth that scientists have had their senses of humour surgically removed In one chapter he recounts a hilarious if uncomfortable evening spent in a Russian sauna where the other researchers insisted on calling him Brain instead of Brian I sat naked in a Russian banya he writes The air in the sauna was so dry and hot it scorched my windpipe all the way down to my lungs The other eight Russian men also naked were leaning against the cedar walls their eyes closed in ecstasy as though slowly roasting yourself alive was the most relaxing thing in the world There s a lot more vodka and jumping through holes in the ice involved but you can find that out for yourself We also are nt going to the smartest You re going to have to go out and buy the book In fact we suggest you pick up two get one for your dog because after all he s a genius Book review History Updated on Saturday February 16

reevaluate their ideas about how the brain works says the lead researcher behind the study Six rats were implanted with electrodes that connect their brains to infrared sensors they wore on the tops of their heads The electrodes were inserted into each animal s somatosensory cortex the part of a rat s brain that is responsible for sensing touch particularly through the whiskers Multimedia Hacking the Brain When the wired rats were placed in a situation where infrared lights were turned on and off around them they first responded as though they were feeling an invisible touch to their whiskers Within a few days however the rats responses changed and they were able to identify and move toward sources of infrared light as though seeing them in the distance They basically started behaving like they re projecting the sensation of touch into the of neurobiology and bioengineering at Duke University in Durham North Carolina who led the experiment What is especially intriguing is that Dr Nicolelis and his colleagues made no special effort to connect the infrared sensors to specific neurons apart from placing then in the general brain region associated with touch We did nt have to go fishing for the right cells says Dr Nicolelis The results suggest that adult brains are for more plastic than expected and aided by socalled neuroprosthetic devices can quickly develop new sensory modalities that operate on top of the conventional five senses Dr Nicolelis says the work could lead to ways of helping human patients acquire a different kind of sight even when the visual cortex is damaged Currently damage to the brain s visual processing centre is considered an insurmountable barrier to regaining a sense of sight In the future Dr Nicolelis adds people who suffer no impairments at all may opt to add to their sensory capabilities with implants that allow them to I tell my students that Superman must have a neuroprosthesis for Xray vision says Dr Nicolelis The study published in the journal Nature Communications is one of several illustrating the rapid advancements under way in brainmachine interfaces The field is the focus of a session on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston The work has also attracted the attention of bioethicists exploring how technologies that enhance the brain may one day change our concept of what it means to be human Despite the futuristic nature of the technology it not too soon to discuss its implications says Martha Farah director of the Center for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia Part of the point in having discussions at this stage in anticipation of these technologies being available is that we can perhaps decide how would we like our society to manage and guide their use says Dr Farah Restrictions All rights reserved framing or similar means is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters Thomson

really should do something about those lines as though a shot of Botox is a matter of simple maintenance like having your leaves blown off your lawn To not do it is seen as a failure of community manners I have also observed women who submit to the facial needle out of a sense of obligation to their physical beauty They may never say this of course but the sentiment is there That their effort to preserve it often goes awry and they end up looking like plastic versions of themselves I m looking at you Nicole Kidman is not the point It s often a function of identity They are their beauty Not to try to sustain it is akin to not fully using the brain you were born with And look like a grouch when they do nt feel they are In her book Lots of Candles Plenty of Cake Anna Quindlen the 60yearold novelist and journalist who famously chronicled thirtysomething life back in the 1980s wrote that she started using Botox for her frown lines in her mid50s because she did nt want to look cross when she was nt And it s addictive she told me with a laugh when I interviewed her about the book This is where the Botoxassex metaphor comes in Once you get a taste of it it s hard not to want a repeat er injection It is the treatment of depression through Botox though that is as new as a baby s skin In The Face of Emotion How Botox Affects Our Moodsand Relationships released two weeks ago Eric Finzi a dermatological surgeon writes of the link between facial expressions and emotions His theories and anecdotal evidence have recently been corroborated by thorough medical studies Incidentally d above which he heard from one of his patients It s not simply that a Botox injection to the face can make you feel happier because you look better That s the assumption many make Finzi acknowledges in an interview from Chevy Chase Md where he lives and works And he does nt dispute that looking good makes you feel good that s his business after all Rather Finzi s work centres around the new and controversial idea that our facial expressions not only reflect our emotions but also cause them It s a facial feedback theory of emotion that he describes as a continuous looping of signals or pathways between muscles and the brain Basically the more you frown the more the brain experiences negative messaging So when Botox inhibits the frown muscle that electrical circuit is clamped off Finzi explains over the phone In 2003 he started a clinical trial to test his hypothesis that Botox inhibition of scientific theories from the 19th century including Charles Darwin s The Expression of the Emotions in Manand Animals in which the celebrated scientist wrote The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it On the other hand the repression as far as this is possible of all outward signs softens our emotions Finally Finzi realized that he had a way to test ancient hypotheses with a modern tool Botox His small studies also piqued the interest of Axel Wollmer a psychiatrist at the University of Basel in Switzerland Last year results of his randomized controlled study on the effects of Botox on depression were published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research showing significant statistical results The study investigated whether patients who suffered from clinical depression and had not responded to antidepressant medications could be helped with Botox injections in their frown lines Participants in the treatment group were given a single dose of Botox five injections between and just above their eyebrows An equalsized Botox symptoms of depression decreased 47 per cent after six weeks and lasted through the 16week study period In the placebo group there was a nine per cent reduction in symptoms Wollmer concluded that Botox interrupts feedback from the facial musculature to the brain which may be involved in the development and maintenance of negative emotion What has hindered investigations into Botox and depression is the stigma it carries as merely a tool for the vain even though its uses for medical conditions such as cerebral palsy Parkinson s disease and migraines are well known Finzi says Do nt blame the molecule he implores with a laugh Do nt attach whatever feelings you have about cosmetic procedures to its potential usefulness for other things I would predict that by the end of 2013 there will be not only one but three randomized controlled doubleblind tests that will have been completed And when all three are published that will be very powerful stuff pharmaceutical companies Depression of course is a serious problem And anything that can help alleviate it is significant But I ca nt help but think that this news would provide the perfect excuse for indulging in Botox from here on in It s not for my vanity darling you could say at swishy soirees as your friends notice your newly unfurrowed brow Women and visible minorities are underrepresented in senior leadership positions across Montreal according to a report published by Ryerson University s Diversity Institute and the Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill The report part of DiversityLeads a fiveyear 25million project funded by the federal Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council SSHRC aims to benchmark and assess the progress of diversity in leadership to develop specific solutions to advance diversity across Canada It examined six sectors elected public private education voluntary and appointments to Agencies Boards and Commissions The study found that women accounted for 312 per cent of senior leadership positions despite comprising 517 per cent of the population of surveyed areas in greater Montreal The figure for visible minorities was even lower standing at only 59 per cent despite visible minorities comprising 225 per cent of the population The problem compounds itself for women that are visible minorities who represent 115 per cent of the population but The corporate sector was found to be the least diverse with women at 151 per cent and minorities at 26 per cent By comparison the government and education sectors both had over 40 per cent women with 96 and 64 per cent visible minorities respectively Wendy Cukier founder and director of the Diversity Institute at Ryerson University and a lead researcher on the project highlighted the significance of the sectorbased approach to this research in an email to The Daily In a phone interview with The Daily Suzanne Gagnon another researcher on the project and a professor of organizational behaviour at Desautels warned that sector averages should not necessarily be taken at face value and that there is often a wide range of representation within sectors She suggested that certain organizations could act as models for others within the same sector She explained that phase two of the research would include a crosssectoral survey and case studies to discover specific reasons for and solutions to the problem Gagnon emphasized the top of an organization has been linked to a company or organization s ability to retain top talent and also as a separate issue although they are linked to an extent to innovate to make innovative and creative decisions drawing on multiple perspectives She also explained that it matters for young people and for their aspirations and for social inclusion more generally to have leaders who broadly represent the population Elizabeth Groeneveld a faculty lecturer and chair of the Women s Studies program at McGill explained that underrepresentation in leadership in Montreal is likely linked to broader systemic racism and sexism There can be impediments in terms of access to education and the kind of mentoring that is often given to men or people who are racialized as white that is not always extended in the same way to women and visible minorities said Groeneveld Gagnon in reference to both the corporate sector and as a general trend described how organizations are selfreproducing entities that a systemic obstacle to introducing women and visible minorities Groeneveld echoed this idea The language of being the right fit for a company can sometimes become code for people who look like us think like us and talk like us Cukier noted that several other projects are in progress as part of DiversityLeads including studies on the representation of Aboriginal people persons with disabilities and members of LGBT communities as well as analysis on the impact of representations of leadership in media Gagnon mentioned that similar studies were also conducted in other major Canadian cities including Vancouver and Toronto Private prisons are run better than those in public sector Private firms are better at running prisons than the public sector and all jails should be subject to open competition an independent thinktank said today Better staffprisoner relationships boosted by the use of first names and mentoring schemes help rid private jails of hostilitiesPhoto PA 245AM GMT 21 Feb 2013 The Government would be wrong to limit the role of private companies within prisons to small contracts such as maintenance and catering the rightleaning group Reform said Some 10 out of 12 privately managed prisons have lower reoffending rates among offenders serving 12 months or more than comparable public sector prisons Reform found Meanwhile the group also called for the end to national pay bargaining for prison officers with pay and conditions to be set locally by governors The coalition Government denied there had been a Uturn on the use of prison competition while campaigners for prison reform said it was almost Tanner who penned the report The Case for Private Prisons said Twenty years of private prisons have created an effective market which is ready to grow Evidence shows that a greater role for the private sector will advance the rehabilitation revolution which ministers want to deliver Private firms have been managing prisons since 1992 but in November last year Justice Secretary Chris Grayling signalled a move away from wholesale privatisation as he decided four prisons including G4Srun HMP Wolds should be run by the public sector Two contracts to run five prisons Acklington and Castington which have since formed Northumberland prison and three in South Yorkshire will proceed to the next stage of the competition with an announcement expected next spring Mr Grayling said private firms will be brought in to all public prisons to run maintenance resettlement and catering to save up to 450 million over six years Policy groups including Reform said the decision amounted to the end of competition although Mr Grayling insisted it did not rule out further prisonbyprison competitions in the future Looking at Ministry of Justice data Reform said this decision was not supported by analysis of prison effectiveness Some seven out of 10 privately managed prisons have lower reoffending rates among offenders serving fewer than 12 months compared to comparable public sector prisons Furthermore Reform said private prisons outperform their public counterparts in four of the performance measures used by the MoJ A total of 12 out of 12 private jails performed better than the public sector at resource management and operational effectiveness while seven out of 12 were better at reducing reoffending However seven out of 12 public prisons performed better than private jails at public protection In the report Mr Tanner argues Private contractors outperform comparable public sector prisons on both cost and quality delivering better value for money for the taxpayer In addition the similar public sector prisons for both long and shortterm prisoners a key Government objective As a result Reform recommends that all prisons should be subject to competition including the private sector It also calls for local pay decisionmaking to be introduced in prisons with governors taking on responsibility for deciding staffing arrangements pay and conditions and performancerelated pay This would spell the end of national pay bargaining for prison officers a move that would spark fury among unions Mr Tanner said Marketfacing pay and adaptable staffing arrangements have not only reduced cost considerably but also improved staffprisoner relationships and internal cultures within prisons Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said Reoffending rates across the entire prison estate are too high and we are pressing ahead with major reforms to tackle this unacceptable problem And let s be clear there has been no Uturn on the use of prison competition The cost of running our prisons is too high and new approach for reducing costs and improving services aimed at reducing reoffending at a faster rate involving the private sector Mr Wright added This simplistic analysis does not tell the whole story a wide range of factors contribute to reoffending including previous criminal behaviour drug and alcohol dependency and the support offenders receive on release from prison This is why we are committed to introducing significant reforms that will bring down our stubbornly high reoffending rates She said It is almost impossible to compare the performance and reoffending rates of one establishment with another partly because prisons hold different categories of offenders and also because prisoners often serve their sentences in a number of different jails It s thought that the chemical resveratrol found in red grapes and red wine is the reason why Resveratrol a chemical

hours Nasa has announced Sunspots are dark spots on the surface of the Sun which appear as turbulent magnetic fields in its surface rearrange and realign The massive sunspot which formed over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday quickly evolved into an unstable configuration and could lead to solar flares which can interrupt our radio communications Scroll down for video Rapid formation The bottom two black spots on the sun known as sunspots appeared quickly over the course of February 1920 These two sunspots are part of the same system and are over six Earths across Nasa scientists spotted the huge sunspot forming through instruments on the agency s Solar Dynamics Observatory one of several spacecraft that monitor the Sun s weather Over the course of February 1920 2013 scientists watched a giant sunspot form in under 48 hours said It has grown to over six Earth diameters across but its full extent is hard to judge since the spot lies on a sphere not a flat disk The sunspot identified by Nasa is formed of several dark blemishes on the surface on the Sun which have evolved rapidly over the past couple of days NASA S SUN WATCHER THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY The Solar Dynamics Observatory contains a suite of instruments that will provide observations leading to a more complete understanding of the solar dynamics that drive variability in the Earth s environment This set of instruments Measures the extreme ultraviolet spectral irradiance of the Sun at a rapid cadence Measures the Doppler shifts due to oscillation velocities over the entire visible disk Makes highresolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible disk Makes images of the chromosphere and inner corona at several temperatures at a rapid cadence Makes those measurements over a significant portion of a solar cycle to capture the solar variations that may exist in different time intense magnetic activity and are actually cooler than the rest of the Sun which leaves them clearly visible as dark spots in the photosphere In reality if the sunspot were isolated from the surrounding photosphere it would be brighter than an electric arc Ms Fox added The spot quickly evolved into what s called a delta region in which the lighter areas around the sunspot the penumbra exhibit magnetic fields that point in the opposite direction of those fields in the center dark area This is a fairly unstable configuration that scientists know can lead to eruptions of radiation on the sun called solar flares The observation comes as the Sun is gearing up for the most active phase of its 11year solar cycle The Sun s magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles This causes large numbers of sunspots appear and the Sun s The increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle Large solar flares often occur during a maximum For example the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome The last solar maximum was in 2000 In 2006 NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958 However more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906 Special landscape has fascinating story CHARLOTTE SQUIRE Last updated 1300 27022013 CHARLOTTE SQUIREFAIRFAX NZ Much to tell

setting fire to a student boarding house where he was living and employed as a casual caretaker Alan Graham Brown 54 admitted lighting a fire in a bedroom of the 19thcentury onetime stately home in Pitt St last May causing almost 60000 damage to the building and costing one of the occupants more than 6000 in the loss of uninsured property including musical instruments a laptop and irreplaceable music composition notes Sentencing Brown in the Dunedin District Court yesterday Judge Michael Crosbie said the facts of the case were a reminder to landlords and students in particular of the immeasurable value of fire and smoke alarms He had no doubt that in the particular case the alarms had saved lives Brown pleaded guilty before trial on one charge of intentionally damaging the house by fire on May 8 last year He and an associate Peter Curran lived on the seven students occupied the ground floor rooms and shared a kitchen lounge and bathroom facilities On the evening of May 8 the students were alerted to the beeping of a smoke alarm They initially thought the noise was from a television programme they were watching But when they went into the hallway they saw a rear bedroom was ablaze They abandoned thoughts of trying to put out the fire called the Fire Service and set about getting everyone out of the building Brown and Mr Curran were both intoxicated and had only just gone to bed after a heavy drinking session The students had to force the door to Mr Curran s room to get him out and once outside he ran back in to rescue the house kittens He was overcome with heat and smoke and had to be rescued from the first floor but he and the kittens suffered no lasting effects The firefighters extinguished the fire only minutes before it would have taken hold of the entire building They told was interviewed 10 days later and denied any knowledge of the fire s origin but about two weeks later he confessed he had lit it He said he had been struggling with mental health issues and wanted to seek help something he said he should have done 20 years ago At sentencing yesterday John Westgate said Brown appeared motivated to make changes He had used his time productively in prison and had reevaluated his life But Mr Westgate said it was probably unrealistic to order reparation Judge Crosbie told Brown it was naive for him to say he wanted to come out of prison and get on with his life With five pages of criminal convictions three now for arson and the majority involving alcohol he must have a serious addiction His actions had caused huge loss to the young man whose property was not insured and the owner of the house was shocked when she saw the results of the fire She was also shocked because Brown at damage caused to precious personal effects in the house The judge sentenced Brown to two years and nine months jail and while ordering reparation would be akin to writing on water he said Brown should have to pay something He directed payment of 6000 reparation to the university student who lost everything and a 15000 contribution to the costs of the insurers Airbus confirmed that South African Airways SAA on Wednesday morning supplied it

skipper Faf du Plessis after South Africa suffered their worst defeat in Twenty20 cricket on Sunday The shorter the format the bigger the chance that one person can change the game and Hafeez changed the game today Du Plessis said after Pakistan beat South Africa by 95 runs With the first match rained out in Durban on Friday night Pakistan took the series 10 courtesy of Hafeez who tore apart the South African attack We gave Hafeez too many options and he was scoring both sides of the wicket said Du Plessis It was only in the 15th or 16th over we bowled much better and managed to restrict them and get some wickets at the end So that s one positive we can take from the game After a dismal Test series Hafeez played an outstanding knock for his 86 off fours and four sixes came to an unfortunate end when his back foot slid onto his stumps and dislodged the bails Pakistan started with intent and had the run rate at over nine runs an over from the seventh over We can learn from them the way they played the first eight overs Du Plessis said They put the pressure on our bowlers and made the rest of the game much easier for themselves Having beaten Pakistan 30 in the Test series on wickets suited to the South African seam attack it was a different matter in the T20 When it comes to playing on a wicket like this one which was very close to being a road their skills are better than ours and that s another area where we want to learn from them Pakistan s opening pair of Nasir Jamshed and Ahmed Shehzad set the pace with the latter smacking two sixes before he was run out on 46 He faced 25 brought Hafeez to the crease but it had no effect on the team s momentum Hafeez reached his halfcentury off 30 balls and achieved his highest T20 score his previous being 71 against Zimbabwe in Harare Du Plessis had to call on his death bowlers midway through the innings and said the only advice he gave his bowlers was not to panic We re building towards the next T20 World Cup so if it means experimenting with inexperienced players then so be it When Pakistan are on fire like they were today they can put the best in the world under pressure and it was a learning curve for our young guys Chasing 196 South Africa opened their innings with AB de Villiers and Henry Davids and tried to replicate the fast start made by the opposition It s the one thing that worked for us today We know what AB can do in the middle order so it was just a case of trying him attack De Villiers scored 36 off 22 balls hitting four boundaries and two sixes until he was castled by Mohammad Irfan Kleinveldt was the only other South African batsman to make a start as Umar Gul took five wickets for six runs off 22 overs And after his masterful batting Hafeez took three for 25 with the ball it was a great feeling to walk into a happy dressingroom said Hafeez after the match I ve missed it for the last 42 days and I just hope we can keep up this good feeling for the oneday series He said during the Test series he always felt he was batting well in the nets but got out to some good balls I have to thank the coaches who always remained positive and lifted my morale I always try and go out there and express myself and today I took my chances because the pressure is on the bowlers in the T20 format you Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the

500GB hard drive has the first two covered but is this the full package Let s have a closer look Freecom Mobile SQ design and build quality The Mobile SQ sports a very lightweight design it has a rounded square shape fits in your hand and is only a little over a centimetre in thickness This makes it extremely portable and easy to slip into a laptop bag or backpack not bad for 500GB of storage The top and bottom are both done in a sandblasted stainless steel with a textured black plastic along the sides There s a single USB 30 port on the back and four flat rubber feet on the bottom The feet were a nice touch which prevented the drive from slipping around without adding much height to it Overall it feels very sturdy and solid A lot of mobile drives you see are done in glossy colours or with striking accents but the Mobile SQ manages a much more understated look that makes it look a lot less like a running shoe than its competition The toneddown looks and rubber feet make it great for a media device to plug in to your television where it should fit in quite nicely My only complaint is the bundled cable which is very short under a metre Freecom Mobile SQ Freecom Mobile SQ features The main selling point of this drive is how compact it is it s one of the smaller drives you ll find at this kind of capacity impressive considering the Mobile SQ is also available with 1TB of storage The 1TB is admittedly a little thicker but not by much Those wanting security features are going to be disappointed the drive does nt come with password protection or any other kind of security so you ll want to keep One thing Freecom have included is a nifty powersaving function that puts the drive into standby when it s finished copying It s not a major selling point but it s neat if you want to leave something large to copy while you re out the house or office The drive is both Mac and Windows compliant and comes with a bit of preloaded software for Windows users in the form of Nero s Back It Up and Burn The software allows you to back up data to the drive as well as format it to your own specifications Unfortunately Mac users are stuck with their own OS tools to do the same job Freecom Mobile SQ Freecom Mobile SQ performance The Freecom Mobile SQ performed reasonably in read and write tests boasting read times of around 104109 MBs and write times just below that at 102107 MBs This is of course using the drive s USB 30 capabilities in a USB 20 port you re going to get a tenth of that It going to get speeds quite a lot lower around 3540 MBs but this is normal and nothing to worry about These performance figures are about what you d expect you would nt want to see numbers much lower than this There are faster drives out there but the difference is nt any cause for major concern Freecom Mobile SQ Freecom Mobile SQ conclusion At an RRP of R999 for the 500GB version the Freecom Mobile SQ is nt what you d call cheap If all you want is 500GB of storage at USB 30 speeds you could get that for as little as R750 However what you are paying for here is the design you d be hard pressed to find a 500GB drive as compact and elegant as this It ll fit in great with your media setup at home and for a lot of people that will be worth the couple of hundred Rands extra Another shack blaze and 100 homeless INLSADesperate residents of Ekuphumleni in Dunoon work hard

federal bench in Nevada Elissa Cadish withdrew her candidacy Friday morning It is with regret that I write to inform you that I have requested that President Obama withdraw my nomination to this position Cadish wrote in a letter to Sen Harry Reid who had championed her candidacy but failed to pull Nevada Sen Dean Heller on board Heller had objected to an opinion Cadish wrote about the individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment several weeks before the Supreme Court settled the proper interpretation of its clauses in District of Columbia vs Heller in 2008 In response to inquiries Cadish said she would uphold the Supreme Court s interpretation as a federal judge Since President Barack Obama nominated Cadish in February 2012 the number of vacancies has grown such that three of Nevada s seven seats on the federal bench are open Cadish cited a concern about that situation in her the ability of Nevadans to get speedy justice particularly in civil cases The Sun wrote about the protracted judicial crisis in the state last month just after Cadish passed her oneyear anniversary of being nominated without having had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary committee That process was held up because Heller citing his concern over Cadish s previous Second Amendment position would not sign the requisite blue slip needed to move Cadish s nomination forward through the Senate process Heller said in a statement he supported Cadish s decision to withdraw This has been an unfortunate situation from the very beginning and I wish Judge Cadish well in her future endeavors Heller said I look forward to working with Senator Reid so that we can avoid similar situations and move swiftly to confirm future nominees In a statement Reid spoke of his continued admiration for Cadish s jurisprudential record and expressed his frustration that the circumstances surrounding her nomination had reached such an impasse Reid said However I agree with Judge Cadish that with three vacancies on our district court Nevada is in an urgent situation and continuing this impasse is not beneficial to our citizens who warrant a speedy judicial process Reid added that he hoped he and Heller could move together to confirm other qualified nominees in the future Nevada currently has two other nominees pending before the Senate Andrew Patrick Gordon who is expected to receive a confirmation vote soon and Jennifer A Dorsey A mass extinction of lizard species is a real possibility in coming decades as a result of climate change new research from the University of Lincoln has found Certain lizard species have taken a onedirectional evolutionary path that involves them giving live birth rather than laying eggs this has allowed lizards to live further north than possible if they were laying eggs But this evolutionary path is apparently ireeversible once a lizard species has developed it they lose the ability to go back to laying eggs which would be necessary for them in a wamer climate The speed at which climate change is occurring largely precludes many species from simply changing where they live it s possibly for some species but many will very likely go extinct as a result of not being able to extend their range to more appropriate climates The researchers predict that dozens of lizard species may become extinct within only the next 50 years It s been observed all over the globe that lizards with lizards with viviparous reproduction such as in skinks are doing poorly with regards to changing weather patterns And the new research shows that is likely their viviparous reproduction an adaption that has been key to their success in the past that is limiting their ability to adapt Researchers including academics from the University of Exeter investigated the hypothesis that historical invasions of cold climates by Liolaemus lizards one of the most diverse groups of vertebrates on earth have only been possible due to their evolution to viviparity live birth from oviparity laying eggs Remarkably once these species evolve viviparity the process is mostly irreversible and they remain restricted to such cold climates By analysing this evolutionary transition in the lizards reproductive modes and projecting the future impact of climate change the scientists discovered that increasing temperatures in the species historically cold habitats would result in their areas of distribution being significantly reduced As a consequence if global warming continues at the same rate viviparous lizards are facing author Dr Daniel PincheiraDonoso said Lizards reproduction is largely linked to climatic temperatures and viviparous species are usually found in cold environments When reptiles initially moved to colder areas they needed to evolve emergency measures to succeed in these harsh places and we believe viviparity is one of these key measures However this transition is mostly onedirectional and unlikely to be reversed Rapid changes in the environment s temperature would demand rapid readaptations to secure the species survival Through the research we found that over the next 50 years nearly half of the area where these species occur may disappear causing multiple extinctions due to climate change The general conclusion of the research is that although viviparity allowed lizards in the past to invade and adapt to live in cold environments and was therefore a key trait for evolutionary success it will now ultimately lead to multiple events of extinction Dr PincheiraDonoso said These lizards are one of the most diverse groups of animals and are able reduction in cold environments will reduce their areas of existence which means that their successful evolutionary history may turn into a doubleedged sword of adaptation Their extinctions would be an atrocious loss to biodiversity Dr Dave Hodgson from the University of Exeter said Climate change must not be underestimated as a threat to modern patterns of biodiversity Our work shows that lizard species which birth live young instead of laying eggs are restricted to cold climates in South America high in the Andes or towards the South Pole As the climate warms we predict that these special lizard species will be forced to move upwards and towards the pole with an increased risk of extinction The new research was just published in the journal

Newberry Library in the small Washington Square Park across the street and celebrating the bygone era when that park was regularly filled with soapboxes and atop them an assortment of orators and lunatics Of course Durica was nt actually Reitman the 2785TOOLONG of Emma Goldman the 28114TOOLONG and frequent Bughouse Square presence Reitman died in 1942 But Durica was doing a fine job of bringing him back to life in cape floppy hat scarflike Windsor tie and dashing manner Why I wondered would such a young man inhabit an all but forgotten character Growing up in Cleveland I spent a lot of time with my grandparents who lived on the same block he says They would regale me with stories of World War II and the Depression and they had very detailed scrapbooks that made history come alive for me Durica earned a of Michigan and came to Chicago in 2005 as a doctoral candidate in the Department of English Language amp Literature at the University of Chicago In 2008 he founded Pocket Guide to Hell Tours pocketguidetohellcom its name taken from a notsokind 19th century observation about Chicago by visiting British labor leader John Burns As I was doing research for my dissertation about tramps hobos and transients in American literature I kept coming upon all of this good material that did nt fit into my academic work he says I wanted to share what I was learning with the broader public His tours quickly morphed into more elaborate historical events Among them have been reenactments of the 1915 Parade of Unemployment and the 1886 Haymarket Riot a Ben Hecht s House Party celebrating the work of the famous 25144TOOLONG and a recreation of the final episode of the early 1950s television program Studs Place His latest production is a bold by the corrupt bosses ie aldermen of the 1st Ward Bathhouse John Coughlin and Michael Hinky Dink Kenna It takes place March 17 at the Hideout 1354 W Wabansia Ave starting at 8 pm and admission is 10 with all proceeds going to the 20some performers I have more than a passing acquaintance with these fellows My father Herman and his collaborator Lloyd Wendt wrote the definitive story of the lives and misdeeds of this duo in 1943 s Lords of the Levee I use that book all the time says Durica It has great material about many things Coughlin and Kenna conceived the First Ward Ball as a way of further stuffing their pockets already bulging with graft through imposed ticket and liquor sales The first ball was held in 1896 and by 1908 it attracted 20000 drunken yelling brawling revelers to the Coliseum on South Wabash Avenue The guests slopped up It was very messy I am a bit too tall but I will try to be suitably taciturn he says For a guy who has been dead since 1946 Kenna is getting a lot of attention His name surfaced in recent Mark Brown SunTimes columns about efforts to close the Ewing Annex Hotel on South Clark Street once owned by Kenna And Friday the Chicago History Museum put on display a solid gold diamondstudded alderman s star that belonged to Kenna But of course Durica knows all that In 201112 Durica was a member of the Newberry s first class of graduate scholarsinresidence Daniel Greene the library s vice president of research and academic programs says What really wowed me as I learned more about Paul s work is his deep commitment to Chicago history and to communicating history to contemporary audiences in fun and engaging ways That kind of says it all But there is more of the recently released Chicago by Day and Night The Pleasure Seeker s Guide to the Paris of America First published in 1893 the book was intended for the hordes of tourists pouring into that year s Columbian Exposition The original text is great fun on its own but Durica and Savage enrich the reading experience with a fine introduction and thoughtful informative notes about such vanished places as the Eden Musee and Palmer Castle and the meaning of dude town When he presents his dissertation and gets his degree in June Durica hopes to pursue a teaching and writing career with the city s history as its foundation and engine But April 14 he and his pals will be dipping into the more recent past and bringing back to life Bozo s Circus at The Hideout There will be a Grand Prize Game and such beloved characters as Cooky Wizzo and you know who Daily Edition The ABCs of Death Film Review Directors of horror and suspense films The Innkeepers VHS Down Terrace and Hobo With a Shotgun contribute to this anthology of 26 short films Perhaps seeking to fill the void between installments of the VHS horrorcompilation franchise after picking up the second installment SVHS at Sundance for release later this year Magnolia Pictures is offering The ABCs of Death as a potential placeholder through its prolific Magnet Releasing genre label Stronger in concept than execution this anthology of short films may initially draw theatrical audiences on the strength of the filmmakers credentials although wider appeal is likely to be garnered with digital formats Producers Ant Timpson and Drafthouse Films Tim League hit on the idea of compiling 26 short films one for each letter of the alphabet into a featurelength program and showcasing directors from a variety of different countries with projects focusing on death as the central theme Some admirably recognizable talents VHS contributor Adam Wingard Down Terrace and Sightseers director Ben Wheatley recent Sundance breakout director Jorge Michel Grau We Are What We Are Timo Tjahjanto whose Safe Haven short was a disturbingly memorable contribution to the upcoming SVHS and cult favorite Yoshihiro Nishimura of Tokyo Gore Police Running times vary from just a few minutes to as many as six or seven forcing the filmmakers to significantly compress their often gruesome narratives Both the originality and quality of the shorts are equally variable with the majority coming off as mere genre exercises rather than fully conceived films Leading off with the first letter of the Roman alphabet Nacho Vigalondo s Apocalypse is nt nearly as ominous as the title suggests focusing on a housewife who bloodily dispatches her bedridden husband after unsuccessfully poisoning him for months impatient for him to meet his demise With the possible exception of Dogfight Marcel Sarmiento s gritty take on a cage fighter who battles a vicious dog barehanded and Iguchi the series does nt really hit its stride until about halfway through with Tjahjanto s Libido Strapped down in heavy wooden chairs two captive men are forced to pleasure themselves for a masked audience while watching various live sex acts with the secondplace finisher summarily and grotesquely executed Shot in an urgent feverish style the wan desaturated color scheme sharply contrasts with the extremity of the men s dire predicament Nuptials from Banjong Pisanthanakun the Thai director of horror film Shutter injects some welcome humor into the grim proceedings A young man presents his unimpressed girlfriend with a colorful parakeet as a gift but when the bird voices her boyfriend s wedding proposal and he proffers a ring she interrupts her meal preparation to show her appreciation The bird however has more to reveal repeating a conversation that apparently took place between the man and his secret lover during a recent tryst a disclosure that quickly enrages the knifewielding girlfriend Pisanthanakun adopts a style amusing contrast to the rapidly escalating onscreen violence Among the animated shorts which include the bizarre HydroElectric Diffusion and the trifling Klutz Lee Hardcastle s claymation Toilet about a boy who s afraid to use the commode lest it devour him is the most successful tapping into subconscious fears with a sly sense of humor Brit filmmaker Wheatley s Unearthed featuring a crazed mob chasing a vampire through the nighttime countryside from the undead s point of view begs for a longer treatment to play out the conflict between the victim and the aggressors Before ultimately closing with the wildly irreverent horror spoof Zetsumetsu from Japanese director Yoshihiro Nishimura Xavier Gens French film XXL is as impressive for its social commentary as the bloodsoaked special effects An obese woman makes her way home as she s publicly ridiculed by passersby at almost every turn Arriving at her apartment she immediately begins binging indiscriminately consuming the contents of her copiously stocked refrigerator to her abundant flesh she begins slicing away the fat even as she struggles to maintain consciousness with increasing blood loss Shooting in a realistic unflinching style Gens capably portrays the woman s desperation to adapt to a cultural norm with a sometimes unrealistic fixation on body image More erratic than consistently frightful The ABCs of Death might have benefited from firmer curatorial guidance but at least it s laid the groundwork for developing a number of potentially effective featurelength films Big Brother Canada BehindTheScenes At A Live Taping Last Thursday I had the opportunity to attend the taping of a Big Brother Canada elimination episode I ventured out into the scary unknown of the suburbs and joined up with other Big Brother Canada fans to see just what goes on in that mysterious studio Here are some things I observed 1 The studio is difficult to find It s in the middle of nowhere out in the vast suburbia of the Greater Toronto Area When I got off the bus I wandered around for about 10 minutes desperately trying to avoid getting lost in a place that appeared to have undergone The Rapture I finally had to bite the bullet and ask the first stranger I saw for directions and he looked at me as if my nonthreatening exterior was just a fa ade hiding a potential axe murderer 2 I waited with the diehard Big Brother Canada fans outside the studio opened to us Shoutout to the guy in front of me who was wearing a nice suit and a bright orange scarf Bold choice sir 3 The studio holds three sections of chairs one of which is partially behind the stage so I m not sure what they were looking at at the front of the 11 000 sq ft Big Brother Canada house A few different textures like brick and stucco are projected onto the side of the white house to make it look more realistic The episode we were watching was also projected onto the side 4 The chairs are extremely close together If you do nt like rubbing bums with strangers and who does nt you probably do nt want to attend a Big Brother Canada taping How do you feel about the first season of Big Brother Canada 5 When I walked into the studio at least four on I like to think this is their only task 6 At commercial breaks we had the opportunity to win Big Brother Canada merchandise shot glasses beer koozies and tshirts but as we had to either dance or answer Big Brother trivia neither of which I can do I refrained 7 I did nt anticipate how much applauding there would be We had to applaud when Arisa entered the studio at the beginning before and after every commercial break whenever anyone answered a trivia question correctly whenever a new person appeared on the stage and whenever Arisa or the producer asked us how we were feeling or whether we were excited Have mercy on our hands BBCan 8 People are crazy about Big Brother Some audience members have a seemingly photographic memory for details of every single Big Brother episode from all versions of the show 9 Arisa Cox is awesome She a lot of TV like Downton Abbey the Walking Dead and the Vampire Diaries 10 My audience overwhelmingly thought that Peter would win the whole thing with Gary a close second Only four people thought that AJ would win it all and

Fated Knight bags it chic These days most indie designers start off by selling their wares through Etsy or craft fairs Then maybe after a year or so their label gains enough traction to score a deal with a local retailer or two if they re lucky But Jennifer Yau is not most indie designers This stylish young firecracker knows how to get products onto shelves She served 10 years in the wholesale trenches working for a global denim brand So by the time she launched her own handbag label One Fated Knight it took her less than a season to get her gorgeous leather goods into 30 stores across Canada including Plenty various locations Fine Finds 1014 Mainland Street and Riot Clothing 1395 Commercial Drive It s an impressive feat and one that s been a long time coming As the Vancouver native recalls even though she d worked her way up to a fairly she had been itching to strike out on her own for quite a while After about two years of repping for the same brand I quickly realized that really was nt my passion after all says Yau who recently sat down with the Straight at an East Van caf Even when I was living in New York I was still working for the same brand although it was a change of scenery But it was the same job Sure it was a better position and I had more responsibility but ultimately I lost my creative edge It was like 50 shades of blue she continues with a laugh before mocking her sales banter of yesteryear This one has three whiskers here so it s a completely different jean Do you want it skinny straight or boot cut Of course these days there s nothing rote or disingenuous about her sales pitch She genuinely loves her product are beyond beautiful The Bishop 198 for example is a classic woven bucket tote that looks like it could come from any era and will only get better with age The same goes for the Archbishop 168 a chic tasselled hobo that like most of her designs comes in cognac or black The most hipster bag in this collection is the eggshell Count 228 a leather backpack with brown suede trim and antiquefinished hardware In addition to creating timeless bags one of Yau s main goals with One Fated Knight was to make her pieces relatively affordable without resorting to pleather Even though designers like Marc Jacobs are a major source of inspiration for Yau at this point in her life she ca nt justify those kinds of prices I know that highend is very coveted and that it exudes luxury and whatnot the designer says But I thought that I can still do that within an attainable price point because with the want to buy stuff but they re not buying 1500 bags well the average person is nt anyway I mean there s definitely a market for the Chanels the LVs Louis Vuittons and all that But I m not going after that market because that s not someone I relate to yet maybe in 10 years when I m making more dough but right now it s like Rent or an LV bag New athletics plans include competitive clubs national focus and outreach UBC s new plan for athletics will debut a competitive club category that could bump some varsity teams down in status The university is testing a new structure for competitive sports that would focus on nationallevel athletes varsity competition and a new category of athletic club This category would accommodate some of the nonvarsity teams that currently operate without funding or facility support The new model is based on Canada Sport For Life s work on creating a pathway for people to stay active from childhood to old age according to UBC VP Students Louise Cowin We tried to map on various components of what we do to fit within this structure she said What we want for all students and faculty and staff is to think about engaged individuals in terms of their physical mental emotional and social self Under the plan a UBC sports club would admit students only carry support as well as access to athletics facilities in nonpeak times Cowin said any competitive team could be eligible for sports club status the Wrestling Club Sailing Club and Quidditch Club would all be in the running Say there was a UBC badminton club which does nt exist right now that wanted to get a start at UBC Then they would have access to the REC centre in morning or early afternoon time she said They would be expected to organize their class schedules to make that possible and if that did nt work they could still get access during prime time but they would have to pay Criteria for what separates a varsity team from a competitive club would be set by the new director of the athletics department External search consultants Odgers Berndtson are conducting the hiring for the position and looking to bring in a director by early summer The director s first task will be to review varsity sports which exclude some sports that receive the privilege of varsity status Some nonvarsity clubs have charged that the process to become a varsity team lacks transparency a criticism upheld by a 2012 external review of UBC s athletics department Those criteria will be clear and we ll have a process which we do nt have right now in terms of how decisions are made Cowin said It is possible that some sports that are currently varsity now might not be when we apply some yettobeestablished criteria to those Other types of competitive clubs could include clubs open to staff faculty and university residents or organized youth academies Cowin said that UBC s ultimate frisbee club could fit in the open category For youth opportunities Cowin cited the students at University Hill Secondary which was recently awarded a sports academy status that allows it to allocate time during the day to training nutrition and sports psychology education Cowin said UBC academies could give the university a leg up in recruiting look to form more partnerships with elite national programs UBC has one such partnership with Swimming Canada which results in nonstudent Olympians swimming alongside varsity athletes She hopes to see sports institutes relocate to campus in order to bring more researchers and expand coaching training in UBC s kinesiology department The other major change concerns recreation UBC REC which is currently run by Athletics could find itself working under the umbrella of Student Development the department that runs things like Imagine Day and the Centre for Student Involvement and Careers Cowin said the university is looking for new recreational programming that could involve students who do nt visit REC facilities Obviously there has to be a deep collaboration and connection Cowin said There s a lot of devil in this detail that we have nt even begun to work through yet It s just a conceptual model at this time but we need to get into that nittygritty work How to curb bureaucratic empirebuilding Goar Donald Savoie is making politicians and bureaucrats squirm with his latest book Whatever Happened to the Music Teacher It challenges the widely held belief that government should be run like a business The young Acadian came to Ottawa with impeccable credentials He was fluently bilingual had a doctorate from Oxford University and a passion for public service There was one problem Donald Savoie did nt seem to understand the bureaucratic culture He went to his deputy minister early in his career and said he felt there were too many people in the department for the amount of work required The reaction was swift Savoie recounts He proceeded to tell me that I was showing a disturbing level of disloyalty to the department He pointed out that if I truly felt this way I should seriously think about leaving That might be one of the dumbest pieces of advice ever doled out by a senior government official Brunswick roots and became a professor at the Universit de Moncton where he wrote more than 40 books about politics public administration and the decline of democracy He is now an internationally respected scholar with seven honorary degrees and an armload of awards medals and prizes He has advised prime ministers premiers corporate leaders the UN and the World Bank The government of Canada could have had all that talent but drove Savoie out The Moncton author now in his 66th year is still making politicians and bureaucrats squirm His latest book Whatever Happened to the Music Teacher challenges the widely held belief that government should be run like a business The title likely to puzzle nonMaritimers came from a conversation Savoie had with a leading Canadian businessman The Nova Scotiaborn magnate had grown up in a small village where the music teacher a provincial employee worked alongside the twoperson bureau of the Department of Natural Resources Today we are told we the businessman said However the Department of Natural Resources is now housed in two fine buildings employing 150 people To Savoie this anecdote encapsulated what has happened to Canada s public service over the past 30 years frontline workers have been sacrificed to make way for offices full of paperpushers managers supervisors and evaluators It is illconceived costly and misguided The bottomline doctrine took hold under prime minister Brian Mulroney who decided the public sector should operate with the same market discipline as private enterprise His four successors have adhered to it slavishly It has never worked and it never will Savoie says The first problem is that the public sector is not in the business of making money In the absence of profitloss statement it has no way of measuring how well it is doing So it fabricates yardsticks and backs them up with reams of reports showing how efficient effective and indispensable it is The second problem the process by which industry gets rid of outmoded products and develops new ones Bureaucrats do nt have the power to pull the plug and politicians seldom do it for fear of offending vested interests The problem is not that government is spending more on new things but that it spends massively on old things The closest the public sector comes to creative destruction is when the prime minister takes a good whack at the bureaucracy as Stephen Harper is doing now Savoie says But the wrong people get cut and the numbers soon creep back up When Mulroney took office 70 per cent of federal employees worked in the field delivering services settling new immigrants assisting laidoff workers running airports preventing pollution and making sure Canadians got their pensions passports and baby bonuses Today the proportion is 57 per cent and shrinking The remedy is obvious Savoie says with the same clearsightedness that once scandalized his boss Figure out what a government department is supposed to do Ottawa still wo nt like it but this time it comes from a man with a global reputation for smart public policy at a time when taxpayers want to know why they pay so many bureaucrats to provide such poor service Here s the wrap from all eight games of the Sweet 16 round today at the BC senior boys Triple A basketball championships at the Langley Events Centre INCLUDING Kitsilano s win over Terry Fox Keep checking back on this posting for more as the day progresses LANGLEY The South Kamloops Titans have earned their shot at a berth in the Final Four The Okanagan champions built enough cushion from a 2918 halftime lead to hold off the chardcharging Belmont Bulldogs in the eighth and final contest of the Sweet 16 dance card Jacob Adams and Elijah HillisGold the South Kamloops back court were solild throughout especially Adams early and HillisGold late pair showcasing their ability to muscle their way into the paint with solid handles and an aggressive attacking mentality Adams finished with a teamhigh 25 points in the victory while HillisGold added 19 Reid Sellars was a constant threepoint threat finishing with 12 points on 4of9 shooting from distance The most unstoppable player on the floor however the field and finished with a gamehigh 32 points Belmont had grabbed the 20th and final berth to the championships when it defeated the Oak Bay Bays in a challenge game following the release of the tournament draw The Titans face Vancouver s Kitsilano Blue Demons in the quarterfinals on Thursday 3 pm WRCA 69 ENVER CREEK 66 OT LANGLEY Third time was almost the charm for Surrey s Enver Creek Cougars Despite two previous losses to the crosstown rival White Rock Christian Academy Warriors the Cougars were looking like a team ready to giant killers and on Wednesday they almost pulled it off Enver Creek s Aaron Nand hit two free throws with 610ths of a second remaining in regulation to force overtime but the Warriors scored the first five points of the extra session battling and clawing its way to a 6966 win Enver is a great team they have a lot of length and a lot of weapons said WRCA head coach Dale Shury of the Surrey RCMP Classic and the Fraser Valley tournament I knew we had to play close to our best game to beat them We did nt but I ca nt take anything away from the effort that they gave tonight The Warriors bolted out to a 2310 lead and Enver Creek trailed by as many as 15 points before the Phil Deeks coached squad made a ripraoring fourthquarter comeback Four players WRCA s Sam Ykema Peter Spangehl Vartan Taneilian Enver s Gurkirat Kular David Ahmad never left the floor logging all 45 minutes Tanielian led the Warriors with 20 points Spangehl added 19 and 16 rebounds while Matt Perrin scored 14 For the Cougars Kular scored 23 points Rajan Gill 12 Nick Jhauj 11 and Ahmad 10 WRCA faces WJ Mouat in a quarterfinal on Thursday 445 pm KITSILANO 65 TERRY FOX 54 LANGLEY Randy Coutts called it a case of firstgameitis That and a stubborn crew of Demons scratch and claw for everything they got Wednesday en route to a 6554 victory and a berth in Thursday s quarterfinal round They did nt go away and they played good on the interior they did a good job of stopping Luka from getting the ball Blue Demons head coach Randy Coutts said of the defending BC champion Ravens who despite heavy offseason graduation losses did their best to limit the effectiveness of Kits bluechip forward Luka Zaharijevic But that said we looked offensively stagnant with the ball continued Coutts Our guys their legs looked heavy and I do nt know if that was the first game of the tournament or what Hopefully this is a wakeup call for us The Blue Demons were set to scout the day s last game between Okanagan champion South Kamloops and Vancouver Island challenge winner Belmont both surprise entries in the 20team field We ll be there to scout them out said Coutts whose team had two appearances I have no idea of either team So we ll put together a game plan and try to get ready Thursday s game was tied 2828 at the half and the Ravens who had three Grade 10 players on the floor down the stretch drive of the game pulled to within four late before coming up short Zaharijevic had 19 points 15 rebounds and five blocks teammate Noah DeRappardYuswack 16 points and 15 rebounds Tom Campbell added 14 for the winners The Ravens top two scorers were 10th graders Guard Liam Hancock had 11 points and nine rebounds forward Mike West a teamhigh 15 points WALNUT GROVE 74 SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL 62 LANGLEY They met in the seventh grade at DRIVE basketball academy and pretty soon afterwards Jadon Cohee and Mindy Minhas had become fast friends He plays the wing and I play the point Cohee said of the pair during their spring and summer club seasons We re best friends for the first time in their high school careers the pair had to oppose each other and what unfolded was a showdown of sorts between two of BC s elite Grade 11 talents In the end despite a prodigious line score that read 27 points 16 rebounds and seven assists the 6foot5 guard Minhas and the rest of Vancouver s Sir Winston Churchill Bulldogs found themselves on the short end of a 7462 score to Cohee and the rest of Langley s No 1ranked Walnut Grove Gators who move on to the quarterfinals tonight 815 pm against the Burnaby South Rebels I am looked upon to score a lot but my whole goal was to shut down Mindy admitted Cohee who nonetheless finished with 21 points six rebounds and five assists He played a hell of a game Once we re on the court the friendship is off But after 40 minutes we re friends again Minhas concurred but was having a hard time with the fact draw was over If you re not first you re last said Minhas I am going to be thinking about this all of next season But I know we are only going to get better from here The Bulldogs played about as perfect a game as could be expected against a Gators team which returned almost all of its talent from the team which lost in last season s final sits No 1 in The Province s Big 10 rankings and is coming off a win over White Rock Christian in the Fraser Valley final Sometimes you have to win ugly gritty and we did that today said Gators head coach George Bergen whose team led just 6862 with 220 remaining when Churchill guard Andrew Claur drove the baseline for a layin They had scouted us fairly well because they did a good job in defensive transition opportunities But in the second half we got grittier and we won the battle on the glass Jesse Mushiana Sam Shin scored 15 for the Gators ST GEORGE S 93 CLAREMONT 80 LANGLEY For a guy who is a raw rookie to all the splendour of playing on BC basketball s highest stage Drew Urquhart does nt shy away from speaking his mind The lights are bright here and it was intimidating but we came out and played hard and aggressive Saint George s 6foot7 Grade 11 swingman said after his team advanced to Thursday s Elite 8 quarterfinals following a 9380 win over Victoria s Claremont Spartans Today my shot was falling but I stayed aggressive That aggressiveness has come from now winning four suddenelimination games in its post season and Urquhart behind a 26point 21rebound performance was helping to lead the way I give Drew an eightoutof10 said Saints head coach Bill Disbrow I think he was real good but I think he can be better and I think he will be tomorrow Urquhart had a lot of 12 rebounds while guard Deklan Chung scored 21 The Saints will get all they can handle Thursday from the Yale Lions in the quarterfinals BURNABY SOUTH 73 SARDIS 69 LANGLEY The Burnaby South Rebels spent an entire regular season testing and retesting their ability to bend but not break It s an old clich for sure but one that a young team took to heart putting it on display over a fourth quarter Wednesday morning that carried them into the quarterfinals here at the BC senior boys Triple A basketball championships In the last three weeks we have been doing that playing through for the whole 40 minutes said Rebels head coach David Smith after his charges built a 14point lead near the end of the third quarter then gave nearly all of it back before retrenching to stop Chilliwack s Sardis Falcons 7369 in the first of eight Sweet 16 matchups at the Langley Events Centre When South point guard Gino Pagbilao drained a threepoint bucket with 138 left in the third Burnaby lead and all of the game s momentum But a Sardis team making its school s first BC tourney appearance in the 80year history of the school came storming back And when Falcons Grade 11 big man Hayden Lejeune was fouled taking a threepointer he was able to step to the line with a chance to pull his team to within 7170 Lejeune made the first two then missed the third After the Rebels made a free throw to make it 7269 Sardis Cam Servatius launched a trey that could have tied the score with 52 seconds remaining The Rebels the Lower Mainland finalists advance to face the winner a later Wednesday game between Walnut Grove and Sir Winston Churchill in Thursday s Elite 8 quarterfinals That was a good team and we had to stop the big guy Smith said of Sardis Lejeune so we junked it up on defence and we seemed to stall them a little Everyone worked hard and we took control of Pagbilao finished with 15 points and seven assists while fellow senior Dejan Posavljak the 6foot6 forward scored 14 points Two other Rebels hit double figures as Martin Bogajev scored 17 and Nick Garcha 13 Lejeune finished with 17 points and 14 rebounds while guard Mike Gregory led the Falcons in scoring with 18 points Jason Kroeker with 11 and Eric Rogers with 10 also hit double figures in the loss for the Falcons Smith credited the stepbystep focus of the season for making a difference in the level of team that took to the floor Wednesday versus the one that opened the start of the season in late November It s hard to finger one thing but individually they just got better Smith said of his team And they understood once the pressure was on that they had to play together and sacrifice Earlier in the season that was nt the case WJ MOUAT 74 HANDSWORTH 65 LANGLEY Tristan Etienne is getting more and more at home team The talented 6foot9 Grade 11forward was at his best Wednesday shooting 8of9 from the field and finishing with 21 points 18 rebounds and five blocks as the WJ Mouat Hawks of Abbotsford outlasted North Vancouver s Handsworth Royals 7465 He struggled a bit in the Fraser Valley championships and for him it is all about energy and playing as hard as he can admitted Mouat head coach Rich Ralston There was no doubt today that he came in ready to go Handsworth jumped out to a 2516 lead early but the Hawks went on a 267 run to build a 4233 lead at the half then found ways to hunker down and answer each and every Royals push over the second half It always helps my confidence when I can come out and help my team get a win said Etienne who still has one more high school season remaining but is starting to hold the attention of collegiate programs I am just trying to help us keep moving we are hoping that we find our peak right here at the end of the season Both Etienne and guard Corey Hauck got stronger and stronger as the game progressed Hauck and fellow point guard Jesse Feenstra each finished with 12 points while forward Daniel Pawliuk and Mitch Howden each reached double figures on offence as well with 13 and 10 points respectively Handsworth swingman Luka Petkovic hit a trio of triple early and finished with a gamehigh 24 points for the Royals while point guard Adam Karmali added 12 points and guard Arman Amini added 10 points The Hawks a fourthplace finisher at the Fraser Valleys advance to meet the winner of a later Wednesday game between White Rock Christian Academy and Enver Creek YALE 95 CALEDONIA 63 LANGLEY JJ Pankratz has already got his collegiate basketball future figured out Jauquin BennettBoire has a few years left to figure it but he s already playing like a fullfledged senior That was the story Wednesday in the Sweet 16 round as the two standouts as the Lions weathered through a stern push from Terrace s Caledonia Kermodes to score a 9365 victory The Simon Fraserbound Pankratz scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the victory while BennettBoire a 6foor1 Grade 10 guard continued to show his remarkably mature game scoring 21 points dishing 11 assists and grabbing six rebounds for the winners Abe Falls the underrated frontcourt starter finished with 13 points and 17 rebounds in the victory which sends the Fraser Valley s No 3 seed into the Elite 8 quarterfinals on Thursday against the winner of the St GeorgesClaremont game The Kermodes who shot 11of29 from the arc got 21 points from Patrick Kurek who himself was a mindnumbing 7of14 from distance Reegan Maki and Marcus MacKay each scored 13 points in the loss for the Kermodes We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts We are committed to

12yearold in California has written a letter to a Supreme Court justice urging him to strike down Proposition 8 the statewide ban on equal marriage Daniel MartinezLeffew who was adopted along with his sister by his dads wrote the letter to Justice John Roberts urging him to strike down Prop 8 but saying that he understands it is a tough decision The video introduced by his father Bryan who says that Daniel heard that Justice Roberts also has two adopted children and decided of his own accord to write a letter to him He says Daniel and his sister thought Hey his family is just like ours He says We were adopted when I was five and my sister was about 12 months old When I was in foster care I was told that I was considered unadoptable because of my Goldenhar Syndrome That is a genetic disorder that affects the whole left Emilio because some people wanted to adopt him but they were nt willing to adopt me because of my medical conditions Lucky for me that s when my two dads came along I recently found out that you yourself adopted two kids a boy and a girl kind of like me and my sister Family means a lot of different things to f different people But some people believe you have to have the same blood to be a family You and I both know that family goes deeper than blood I was lucky to be adopted by two guys I can both call dad They give me and my sister so much love My dads really encouraged me to excel in life Since I want to be a cook when I grow up they are letting me take cooking classes My parents want me to improve whether its school work or my social life I know you have a tough decision to is just as valuable and worthwhile as any other It s especially tough for you because I know you do nt necessarily believe in gay marriage religiously but lucky for us you also do nt believe in taking away a right even from people like us If Prop 8 is allowed to stand imagine the pain we would feel knowing that we are not considered equal to everyone else It s important that all families are protected and valued Why Happiness Should Be a Global Priority This Wednesday sees the very first United Nations International Day of Happiness which is being celebrated around the world on 20 March This follows a recent resolution adopted by all members of the UN General Assembly calling for happiness to be given a greater priority So why are people now taking happiness so seriously at national and global levels Happiness means the quality of life as each person experiences it This is a key outcome in itself and is an important measure of success for any country regardless of the level of economic development It tells us whether people are leading lives they find satisfying and fulfilling So information on the causes of happiness helps policymakers to choose policy goals that serve the real needs of their people But in addition happiness is a major determinant of the other goals that policymakers care about Personal resilience predicts educational performance better than IQ does and higher wellbeing improves work performance and workers earnings at work 40 of time off work and 40 of disability Their overall cost amounts to some 10 of GDP Greater happiness increases life expectancy by contrast depression reduces life expectancy as much as smoking does So happiness is a major contributor to many of our most important social goals As a result of 30 years of research we now know a lot about what affects happiness The main influences are economic personalsocial and environmental On the economic front income is important in every country and poverty is a major source of unhappiness But it is not the only thing that matters In most countries income explains less than 2 of the overall variance in happiness the other identifiable factors explain about 20 Across countries income differences explain about 6 of the differences in average happiness while social factors explain a great deal more Work is also vital for happiness and its importance goes well beyond the income which it provides Education is also important largely as a Turning to personalsocial determinants of happiness the most important in developed countries is mental health In these countries it accounts for 40 of all illness weighted by severity more than heart disease cancer lung disease and diabetes all combined It is also largely a disease of working age so that it has massive economic consequences while physical illness is more concentrated in later life In poorer countries by contrast physical illness has major impacts at every age but mental illness remains an equally important cause of low wellbeing Another crucial determinant of happiness is the quality of human relationships above all in the family but also in the community and at work Secure employment is vital for those who want to work and personal security against violence is vital for everyone Good governance is essential too wellbeing studies show the corrosive effect of corruption and the crucial role of personal freedom and the rule of law Finally comes the environment Research shows clearly the importance of today s environment for design transport systems and green space But the environment is also important in a quite different sense since how we treat the planet today determines the world which future generations will inhabit So when we are considering happiness and quality of life we must take into account those future generations as well as our own The implications of all this evidence are far reaching Here are six of the most important actions which are required if we want to create a happier society Mental Health Evidencebased treatment should be as available for mental illness including depression and anxiety disorders as it is for physical illness Economic Policy Employment is so important that no risks should be taken with economic stability simply in order to increase economic growth Communities Measures to promote economic growth should be accompanied by explicit policies to sustain social cohesion stable family life and personal security Equality More equal incomes are desirable because extra money improves wellbeing more for the poor than a country increases mutual respect and trust which are crucial for wellbeing Schools Schools should aim explicitly at developing young people who are emotionally resilient and eager to contribute to the social good Families Stable families are so important that every society needs its own system of support for couples in conflict Governments should make the happiness of the people the main outcome which they pursue As Thomas Jefferson said The care of human life and happiness is the only legitimate object of good government That is why there is now a growing demand to include subjective wellbeing in the new post2015 Sustainable Development Goals But perhaps most importantly of all we need to encourage a more empathic and caring culture where people care less about what they can get for themselves and more about the happiness of others This is why I m supporting the Day of Happiness when Action for Happiness is encouraging people everywhere to make a personal pledge to live in a way that contributes made that our central purpose in life we would have a far happier and more cohesive world You may also like Beyonce has

that mean Richard OBrien writer of hit musical The Rocky Horror Show delighted in shaking up the conservative sexual attitudes of the 1970s His most famous creation Dr Frank N Furter brought the house down with his song Sweet Transvestite But the show s creator was ashamed about his own longheld desire to be more feminine I was sixandahalf and I said to my big brother that I wanted to be the fairy princess when I grew up The look of disdain on his face made me pull down the shutters I knew that I should never ever say that out loud again For 50 years OBrien repressed the feeling But you ca nt just put the lid on things and pretend that they do nt exist he says I believe myself probably So a decade ago he started taking the female hormone oestrogen and is happy with the results It takes the edge off the masculine testosteronedriven side of me and I like that very much I think I ve become a nicer person in some ways slightly softer For the first time in my life I ve started to put on a little bit of weight which I like He has also developed small breasts But OBrien is not intending to go further and have sex reassignment surgery I do nt want to pretend to be something that I m not Anton Rodgers the actor said you re the third sex And I thought that s quite nice I quite like that position It s my belief that we are on a continuum between male and female There are people who are hardwired male and there are people who are hardwired female but most of us are on that continuum and I female OBrien s idea of a gender spectrum may sound farfetched to many but there is scientific research that backs up his position Cambridge University psychology professor Melissa Hines says there are not two distinct sexes male and female There are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they areProf Melissa Hines I think that the research in this field suggests just the opposite That there is not a gender binary that there s a range of gender and there are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they are on each of these dimensions Professor Dinesh Bhugra of the Institute of Psychiatry at King s College London offers a different view suggesting that while people may feel not entirely male or female the reality is that they are born one or the other The distinction has to be a social construct sex is biological My guess would be that social notions of gender dictate how we behave So how can one explain the feeling experienced by some transgendered people of having been born into the wrong body and wanting to switch sex It has been observed that the brains of maletofemale transsexuals resemble female brains in one region central to sexual behaviour But it is not clear that this is a cause of transgenderism rather than an effect Find out more Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 18 March 2030 GMT and Sunday at 2130 GMT Hines thinks the male hormone testosterone may have a part to play She has noticed that girls who have been exposed to unusually high levels in the womb tend to prefer stereotypical boys toys like trucks And they are more likely than other girls to grow up wanting to live as men The UK s main gender identity referrals last year There they are assessed by psychiatrists who will help them adjust to their preferred gender role After two years of living as the opposite sex in the UK you can apply for a gender recognition certificate which allows you to change your birth certificate To qualify there is no obligation to have changed your body in any way through hormones or surgery That means you can officially be a woman with a man s body or vice versa Stephen Whittle professor of equalities law at Manchester Metropolitan University realised as a 10yearold that he did nt feel right as a girl It was school races day and there were girls races and boys races It was my light on the road to Damascus this sudden realisation that I was always going to be in the wrong race Image caption Stephen Whittle campaigns for transgender rights At 17 he started the process of changing sex Surgery has left him with what considers himself straightforwardly a man This is typical says James Barrett lead clinician at the Charing Cross National Gender Identity Clinic Most of his patients identify as a man or a woman rather than somewhere in between People who are seeking drastic surgical or hormonal treatment because they wish to live in a socially ambiguous gender role are thought about really carefully The concern is that one does nt want to do anything that s irreversible and then have them in a position where they re not happy The problem is says Dr Barrett they have to fit in to a society that that thinks in terms of just two sexes It may well be that biological findings report that in fact everybody s on a spectrum It s just that the way society works most people do nt think of themselves as on any kind of a spectrum at all The same is probably true of sexual orientation Most people do nt describe actually practically speaking it very much is Some transgender people do not choose to change their bodies completely however This can lead to complicated situations such as people who choose to live as women but who have male genitalia being sent to jail for sexual offences Should they be imprisoned alongside men or women Image caption Official documents typically ask if the respondent is male or female The law is clear that such a woman should go to a women s prison says lawyer and former MP Lord Carlile He was the first to raise the issue of transgenderism in Parliament in the 1990s If somebody goes into a court and is accused and their original name was John Smith and they choose to call themselves Jane Smith they will be tried as Jane Smith I do nt see why what a court recognises should not also be recognised by the prison service Awkward though it as challenging and difficult According to Whittle the UK is gradually removing the requirements for people to declare whether they re a man or a woman It has already happened with laws as diverse as the Sexual Offences Act and the Road Traffic Act He thinks the UK will follow Australia and Spain in doing away with the need to tick a box on your passport stating if you are male or female Which box does Richard OBrien tick I tick the M he says But I would quite like to have Other to tick Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio

March 28 2013 at 817 pm Updated March 29 2013 at 615 am TMobile USA ended its silence around layoffs at its Bellevue headquarters on Thursday as hundreds of employees lost their jobs Between 200 and 300 employees in the company s operations group were laid off ranging from administrative assistants to senior vice presidents That s in addition to a layoff of 100 employees in the marketing department earlier this month While the cuts were not unexpected employees said they received little communication from the company about the situation with some taking issue with how the layoffs were carried out In a prepared statement TMobile noted that in New York on Tuesday it announced a new business strategy aimed at reducing costs and complexity for consumers As a result we are making some operational changes to better align our business with our new strategy and position TMobile for growth the statement said overall size of the business and while we do nt take these actions lightly

wireless company still based in the Seattle area an area that spawned the modern wireless industry in the 1980s when McCaw Cellular established a national network Last year TMobile had about 4800 employees at its Bellevue headquarters and 36000 nationally The layoffs come as TMobile is preparing to go public after it merges with Dallasbased MetroPCS in a deal that shareholders are voting on April 12 They definitely are whittling down to the leanest organization they can survive with said Michele Clark a sevenyear veteran of the company who was working as an executive assistant in the operations group when she was laid off Thursday Another affected employee said people had been anticipating the cuts in part because the humanresources group had reserved conference the list when she received an electronic calendar invitation to meet with a supervisor The invitation came after the employee and others on the team worked over the weekend to prepare for the new service plans launched Tuesday You have a half an hour to do whatever you need to do then give your badge and leave the employee said I ve never dealt with anything so unprofessional Remaining employees are seeing other costcutting moves from the loss of free beverages to the mysterious removal of office clocks A person with knowledge of the situation said the clocks were removed because the TMobile buildings centralized clock system was broken and the firm that built and serviced the system is out of business Layoffs and uncertainty have prompted a number of TMobile employees to pursue jobs at ATampT which has had a large presence in the area since it acquired McCaw in 1994 In Redmond ATampT manages operations in the Western US and performs engineering and testing It has 4592 employees in folks making inquiries here for some of our openings said Fred Devereux president of ATampT s West region We encourage it TMobile has nt been saying much internally about rumors over the past couple of weeks that layoffs were imminent according to the employee who was laid off this morning The only communication that we got about this was rumors the employee said Meanwhile the employee is fuming

over Capital One in the first round Inside the NBA s New Style Wars The rivalry among the NBA s elite has spilled off the court and into an arena where athletes have historically feared to tread high fashion Players show up for games wearing leather pants lensless glasses and printed silk shirts and that s just Russell Westbrook GQ s Steve Marsh spent a week trailing basketball s biggest names Kevin Durant Kobe DWade LeBron to find out how they re turning the league into a runway for the world s tallest peacocks The moment Russell Westbrook steps off the bus in Denver for the Oklahoma City Thunder s game against the Nuggets you get the feeling that something insane is going to happen tonight He s wearing red leather motorcycle pants a Superdry bomber jacket black Doc Martens with the laces undone and his trademark superfluous eyeglasses A meager runway gallery awaits him just a few security guards OKC s team photographer and me but he still disembarks with pinstriped spinnaker on draft night to pure line cut slim enough to make Beckham look like a slob Russ is a radical His style is a punk provocation a sartorial troll and most crucially a fullon style not just a series of outr outfits that no other player has the guts to wear He s swinging a leather Dopp kit with his right arm in a repetitive motion that could only be described as swag young black and Oi and generally looking like he s striding out of Malcolm McLaren s London SEX shop in 1976 Every element of hiscostume is an extension of the identity he projects part worldly NBA superstar part suedehead hooligan A few hours later in what NBA bloggers now refer to as the queso incident Westbrook lives up to his look It all starts during a timeout when Rocky the Mountain Lion the Nuggets plushy yellow mascot heaves up a perfectlooking halfcourt shot If he makes side of queso from Qdoba But as the ball slomos toward the rim Westbrook races over leaps up and pulls a supervillain move intercepting it and inspiring the most scornful cascade of boos I ve ever heard Westbrook s styleprovocateur act has already become renowned in the NBA because he stars on one of the league s two best teams appears regularly on nationally televised games where coverage of that short catwalk from the bus to the locker room is de rigueur and is expected to return to the NBA s fashion week the Finals in June But he is only one point of light in the league s new stylesavvy firmament just one Instagram account in a sea of vanitymirrored baller selfies After all the Thunder are merely watching the Heat s bespoketailored throne While Kobe Bryant can stand outside the Lakers locker room and proclaim to me I m the Valentino of the NBA as he explains that he s leaving the preppyhipster look Three LeBron James Dwyane Wade Chris Bosh can not relax Not in a league where Amare Stoudemire can be found posting up in the front row of the Lanvin show at Paris fashion week where Rajon Rondo s retinue is trying to persuade Givenchy to pour a custom mold exclusively for his size 13 feet where Steve Nash can pull the fauxdisaffected Clooney brushing off my questions about his style with an I do nt take it that seriously while going Gatsby that s Kobe s nickname for him in a suit from a Canadian madetoorder Internet clothier that he has a financial stake in A few days later Westbrook s publicist tells me that within certain rarefied fashion circles RW is known as the Kate Moss of the NBA Evidently somebody at Vogue wrote this to her in an email When I ask Russ how he feels about being compared to a female British supermodel famous for making heroin chic and saying things like Nothing tastes as good as with it It s a little different he says But I think it got said because some people are not afraid to do certain things or wear certain stuff You have to have a certain swagger about you Even Westbrook has his limits of course Kanye s infamous leather kilt for instance Though in his next breath Russ allows that he d be open to it if it were a slimmer fit The NBA has had fashion moments before Clyde Frazier wearing his widebrimmed Borsalino on the cover of Esquire the introduction of the Air Jordan in the mid 80s Allen Iverson bringing cornrows baggy jeans and garish jewelry from the hood to the hardwood in the late 90s but the sine waves of high fashion and lockerroom style have never synced up quite like they do right now More than in any other sport basketball showcases the individual we can see each player s tics and idiosyncrasies when he s on the who we think he is And at least as far back as Frazier no sport has been more enmeshed in the allure of black culture and style But recently whether it s sparked by the explosion of social media or the imposition of David Stern s corporatefriendly dress code or whether it s just the logical outcome of the ongoing gene splice of NBA superstars to multinational apparel companies the players are more selfaware than ever more cognizant that personal style is a prerequisite for personal brand Whether they actually love fashion or not they understand the need to be perceived as style leaders at least of some kind in order to maximize their shoecompany contracts Consider the OKC Thunder When they re in uniform Westbrook and his AllNBA teammate forward Kevin Durant are the league s youngest most exciting BatmanandRobin act in street clothes the term feels nearly archaic they are two opposite fronts in the NBA s escalating style wars If Westbrook is the NBA s Kate Middleton aristocratic and punctilious Whereas Westbrook invites regular hazing from Charles Barkley and threequarters of Twitter for dressing like a badass Ziggy Stardust in glammy Neil Barrett silverleather shirts and Givenchy hoodies Durant keeps it on the Take Ivy tip seldom venturing far from the preppedup hipster look favored around the league of late pairing his Air Jordans or AF1s with various combos of customtailored cardigan collared shirt and corduroys He s running for president not leading an insurgency Compared to the NBA s established style kings Durant is still on the climb newly intrigued still searching for his look I always wanted to be fly he tells me outside a Barneys in Santa Monica where he ca nt find one piece of offtherack clothing to fit his superelongated limbs I always put stuff together he says But it was hard for me to find clothes since I was so tall my feet were so big my arms were so long biggest barrier Not one designer in the industry not one is thinking six feet nine 235 with a plus wingspan when determining next season s look Another is functionality NBA players sweat for a living They re most comfortable in workout clothes because that s where they live Until last season Durant was that guy Then he was approached after a game by Regi Puckett an enterprising stylist in Chicago who told him he could push his look beyond the schoolboy 3054TOOLONG gimmick he made famous during the previous year s playoffs Now Durant can screengrab a picture of a peacoat or a pair of slacks that he sees in a magazine or a blog and send it to Puckett who will get the piece constructed to Durantula proportions Westbrook on the other hand is normalhumansized he s six feet three and can buy straight off the rack He s loved shopping since his mother brought him to downtown LA s fashion alley as a little kid after working out I ll find some shops and go check it out and see if they have some new stuff See what s good I go to Barneys I go to Gucci Louis YSL I go everywhere Rodeo Drive Vivienne Westwood Marc Jacobs Joyrich I m all around He s found friends within the haute couture scene tagging along with Vogue s Andr Leon Talley during New York s Fashion Week last fall ALT s not really into sports he says but we were able to conversate about the history of fashion and I was able to get his perspective on the shows and how the fabrics and the clothes fit on the different girls and guys Westbrook is especially proud that unlike his peers around the league he s never hired a stylist So proud in fact that he s hired a publicist to trumpet the fact that he s never hired a stylist I know I know people that can get me clothes he says But it s not like I have somebody that comes to pick out my outfits The surest sign that Westbrook has crossed over as a style icon is the venom he inspires When I ask Puckett who the most stylish man in the NBA is he insinuates that it s Kevin and takes a playful jab at Russ in the process I ll say he shares a locker room with the guy that has the most people talking about what he s wearing Durant immediately defuses stylerivalry talk When I look in the mirror and I feel good about myself that s the only person I m trying to impress Later when I talk to Westbrook he does nt rise to the bait either but it s clear where he rates in his own mind I tell him Durant admitted to me that he tunes up his look when he s in a big city like Los his hometown Nah he says dismissively I dress up everywhere Timewave zero for the modern era of NBA style is 2005 when the league adopted its new dress code Vague enough in its language dress slacks or dress jeans dress shoes or dress boots collared shirt on the way into the locker room no chains pendants or medallions worn over clothes no hats etc it was strictly enforced upon introduction You may recall some controversy There were cries of racism complaints that the league was cracking down on hiphop fashions in deference to squirrelly corporate sponsors The architect of the code NBA commissioner David Stern has always dismissed that idea Our guys were photographed coming into buildings looking like they were going to a day at the beach he explained to me What no one disputes Stern included is that a cottage industry bloomed in the code s wake At this moment in 2013 a sixfootseven bespoke tailor with a showroom in downtown Los Angeles his clients for suits and separates include Blake Griffin Chris Bosh Amare Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler to Laure Heriard Dubreuil a wellconnected French owner of a 20000squarefoot multiluxurybrand boutique in Miami Beach called The Webster to the woman who has elevated the league s sartorial game higher than anybody else the Harlembased stylist Rachel Johnson a former Essenceassistant who went on to do video shoots for JayZ and NERD before landing bigname NBA clients like LeBron James This network cajoles American and European designers into expanding the top end of their size runs Dubreuil has successfully lobbied Givenchy to offer menswear sizes up to 62 and ensures that the players get dibs on items from seasonal lines Just before New York s spring Fashion Week I accompanied Johnson on a mission to Calvin Klein s midtown showroom to pull olood blazers for Stoudemire STAT s measurements are then sent to Milan where the jackets are sewn to his size that an NBA player can help masculinize their clothes Anybody with any insight understands a ampx2018 real guy looks to an athlete before he looks to a waify model she says or even an actor Stern freely admits he never saw this coming and then goes on to imply that he kinda saw this coming Right after the code was instituted a lot of players would whisper to me I do nt know what the fuss is about Let s go There was a sense that this allowed players to express their sense of style Our players individually took it as a catalyst to show themselves off And suddenly the response from the public was so overwhelmingly positive that you know it s getting to be like the red carpet at the Grammys Who s dressing you tonight Armani Now they are among the bestlooking bestshaped models in the world When I first hook up with the Miami the Oracle in Oakland where they ve just knocked off the Golden State Warriors LeBron scored the 20000th point of his career tonight making him the youngest ever to reach this milestone and the media scrum around his locker has hardened into a callus Across the room from Bron Chris Bosh is in one corner already dressed in a light fern unbelievably slim custom Waraire Boswell suit and a CB tie bar with a hardcover of Laura Hillenbrand s Unbroken visible from his unzipped black Parabellum bag Dwyane Wade is pulling on a pair of electricblue Scotch amp Soda trousers which he hikes up to showcase his multicolored hosiery as he hollers You need to raise your sock game in Ray Allen s direction This kind of style smack is constant in the Miami locker room says veteran swingman Shane Battier so constant that it s when they stop talking about you that you know you re in trouble Battier who limits his own aspirations to with jeans says that the pressure on Miami s Big Three to dress well every day can be too much for even the most tasteful global icon LeBron falters occasionally Battier declares And when he does we let him know about it Bosh who also works with Rachel Johnson tells me that while he and Bron like to be stylish and comfortable he thinks Wade is more willing to suffer for fashion Wade agrees I take more risks knowing there are going to be jokes he says Chris does nt take many risks he dresses very nice but he keeps it simple Perhaps Wade s most famous risk to date is the pinkchocolateyellow patent leather Louboutins he wore to the White House on January 28 for the Heat s traditional 2686TOOLONG photo op with President Obama Wade admits he was nervous about wearing the sneakers on such an official state visit and had to be nudged by his stylist s former assistant I m always more nervous than her because I m the one who has to put this stuff on he says This is my second time going to the White House as a champion This time I decided on the gray suit I knew everybody was going to go with something dark so I wanted to do something different And I had the graywhiteandblack shoes out that went with the suit and then there was the pink pair So we sat and thought about it ampx2018 Okay I can go with the graywhiteandblack ones but that s typical and I do nt do typical all the time so let s do something a little different And it worked At the ceremony in the East Room and apologies in advance for the logrolling especially since 32114TOOLONG logrolling is the worst kind but I have to do it if only for the benefit of the archivists Obama said the and soul of this team continue to do whatever it takes to win including leading the team in blocks and at the postgame press conferences he dressed well enough to land himself in GQ magazine The president then turned away from the podium and in a scene reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson s CGI d bemusement with Forrest Gump s bare ass called out Show em your kicks here Dwyane Satisfied Obama turned back to the crowd If any of you can pull this off other than Dwyane Wade let me know Fashion is fun to me Wade tells me later I feel like the way that I dress says a lot about my personality A lot of people will not get a chance to talk to me but when they look at me they can get an idea of who Dwyane Wade is While the Heat are in DC hanging with the president I pay a visit to Johnson inspiration board On the wall behind her desk is a black pinboard with a collage of looks from fashion magazines cut and pasted underneath each one of her famous clients It all feels so imperial courtiers of the court Can you imagine Magic or Larry ever having an inspiration board But Johnson has a specific trajectory in mind for LeBron and Bosh for the second half of the season She wants to continue putting distance between them and the preppy look that David Stern affectionately refers to as nerdwear Wade and Barnett meanwhile have their own plan for the spring draining the color from Wade s look and focusing on texture and silhouette partly to showcase Wade s maturity and partly as a crosspromotion for the Chinese shoe company Wade promotes LiNing whose spring line is the Black Collection When I reconnect with the Heat in Brooklyn two nights after their White House trip it s the team s firstever visit to the Barclays Center two weeks before the beaverfur bomber hat his teammates are calling him the Black Russian and a dark green motorcycle jacket by the young British designer Adrien Sauvage Wade is not quite in Westbrook territory he loves clothes but hates to shop My stylist has done an unbelievable job of opening my mind he says Without her I would be behind the curve She helps me be in the now and in the future After the game a blowout win for the Heat the visitors locker room is predictably jampacked There s a GQ photographer in here and plans for a showoffy shot are being hatched but DWade has to shout across the locker room at LeBron to be heard over this din HEY WE GON NA DO THIS PICTURE LeBron looks confused amid all the commotion He shouts back I DU N NO YOU GON NA DO IT They decide to do something unusual They walk out together sharing the one he wore coming into the arena It s dressier This time it s an APC peacoat over a crisp white shirt and tie He has a black watchman s cap tilted on his head Wade is still rocking the Black Russian The two of them are flanked by security guards who are meanmugging through the phalanx of lingerers in the Barclays loading dock LeBron and Wade get caught in an eddy against a wall where they smile and say hello to a pair of female fans The photographer is told to stop shooting because nobody wants this to look weird But we re running out of catwalk Finally the girls leave Resources Use of this site

week why unplugged versions of songs are so often preferable to their more fussedover studio counterparts Phil Kingston writes rereleased acoustic version of the Steve McQueen album and it sounds better than the original Which prompts the question Why do unplugged recordings work Did the first production choices not get it right Why does stripping down a song make it feel more authentic deeper etc For starters you use an important word in your question authentic As music listeners we ve all got a few cynical synapses that fire when we sense we re being tricked think especially recently of the goosing of vocals via AutoTune No matter how much we know about the process by which a record was made it s easy to shrug off a song s sound when we can hear the sweeteners and the heavy hands of studio Frankensteins wellversed in turning marginal talents into slick superstars When Adele strolled in to the NPR Music offices a few years ago to perform a threesong Tiny Desk Concert on the eve of 21 s release her band did nt exactly play her voice rang out without amplification No filters no microphone no AutoTune no way to mistake her for anything but the powerhouse captured on her records Every inflection every emotion rang out without assistance everyone I talked to afterward was like No AutoTune there Credit NPR Truly unplugged unamplified performances serve the same purpose They strip away what we see as smoke and mirrors to reveal a lot of essences the essence of a voice the essence of a melody the essence of a song s sturdiness and versatility while also applying a veneer of timelessness Production techniques come and go from the electric pianos and saxophones of so much 80s music to the overtly employed sweeteners that have turned up in a lot of pop music in the past decade Love those techniques or hate them they tend to cement a song s place in a very specific era of popular music which is why when Bon Iver dressed its 80s signifiers so many fans recoiled Our brains move on from outdated sounds in ways that make them seem jarring when we revisit records years and especially decades later YouTube When bands unplug particularly when everything is boiled down to a voice and a guitar those performances are rendered largely immune to obsolescence Johnny Cash s voiceandguitar masterpiece American Recordings followed a fallow period in which Cash released a string of sterile studio recordings but when that first Rick Rubinproduced album came out in 1994 it could have come from virtually any era Cash s weatherbeaten voice obviously boomed out of a specific time in his life and many of the songs were of recent vintage but nothing else on American Recordings was tethered to any era YouTube In music as in many fields that lean on technology today

for a sixth season RHONY will be featuring a cast shakeup this season Only a few former members have been asked to return The Real Housewives of New York City Cast Revealed Out of the six main cast members from the series only three have been asked to return according to Naughty But Nice Rob Ramona Singer Carole Radziwill and Heather Thomson have all been offered a spot on the show for the sixth season and they ve all accepted However Sonja Morgan LuAnn de Lesseps and Aviva Drescher are still waiting to hear of their fates add brand new members Regardless of who snags a spot on the show there is sure to be some juicy drama in the big apple as always RHONY Season 6 Filming Delayed Though the reality show is confirmed for a sixth season filming has come to halt Filming was supposed to begin in January 2013 but has been delayed multiple times The cast has not been notified of when filming will start again but Ramona Carole and Heather have nothing to worry about Rumors that the show is being cancelled have surfaced due to the delays but they are all false HollywoodLifers are you excited for Season 6 of the RHONY Tell us below Why do we imprison people who are addicted to illegal drugs instead of treating them for their addiction That question is at the heart of David Sheff s new book Clean Overcoming Addiction and Ending America s Greatest Tragedy It reports the latest medical and scientific research about addiction and recovery which Sheff says shows that drug addicts are gravely ill afflicted with a chronic progressive and often terminal disease Sheff s research is motivated by having watched his son Nic s addiction nearly destroy him and the family Nic started smoking marijuana when he was 12 and eventually moved on to shooting heroin and crystal meth He became homeless living on the streets in cars in parks and when he did come home he stole from and lied to the family Sheff wrote about how the family lived through his son s addiction in the bestselling memoir Beautiful Boy Nic wrote about his addiction in two memoirs and has been clean for five years David his family s experience and why he feels the nation s approach to drug treatment failed his son Interview Highlights On the first time his son got high Nic describes the first time he used in high school as transformative It was nt so much about being high it was about feeling OK for the first time in his life He said that he did nt know it was possible to feel an absence of the intense anxiety that he felt the intense depression So when he got high it was just lifechanging Addiction is a disease like anything else It s like cancer like heart disease like diabetes And we know that at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment On why we should nt wait for a person to hit rock bottom before getting them help I ve heard over and over again we re told that they had to let their kids you know their husbands their back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment and say Please help me That idea it is so dangerous It has killed so many people The other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it s not being treated it gets worse So the longer we stand back and allow this to happen and allow the drug use to continue and allow the behavior that is caused by the drug use to worsen so that someone is going to use more drugs and it s just a cycle the harder it is to treat them So addiction is a disease like anything else It s like cancer like heart disease like diabetes And we know that at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment If someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure

a long time It was after Nic and I talked to you on your show and you know one day we were together and he said I can not believe what I did I was at someone s house Just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet There was a bottle of Vicodin I thought to myself Just one which is common for addicts themselves and to us and soon the bottle was gone and he said I woke up this morning and realized that if I do nt do something I am going to be back on the streets within a week So this was the first time I did nt have to say a word He got on the phone he called the Hazelden treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day To me it s possible to look back on that and say all the treatments before that were a failure Here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again But for me it s the opposite It shows that the treatments had helped him so much that he was able to recognize that he was in a free fall On one of the problems he has with the 12step program The 12 steps are a completely profound treatment for so many people but not most people and that s the problem that It s only in the programs many many rehabs are based on this idea that the 12 steps are the key are the only way to stay sober That s my problem You get people in treatment especially teenagers I mean what is it to be a teenager It is to feel you know this powerfulness and part of the 12 steps is that you have to admit that you are powerless over your addiction You have to turn your life over to a higher power you know Teenagers some do of course but part of being a teenager is that you re not going to turn your life over to anyone Author Website Tips The Importance Of A Call To Action Writer s Relief has a subsidiary company Web Design Relief in which we design websites for

s Ministry of Water Resources announced the results of a threeyear survey of the country s waterways revealing startling declines in water supply According to the census there were 22909 rivers in China as of 2011 each covering an area of at least 100 square kilometers That marks a decrease of about 28000 from the government s previous estimates raising fears among environmentalists and putting Beijing on the defensive China s longest rivers the Yangtze and the Yellow have each seen decliningwater levels in recent years but the government s survey its most comprehensive to date may shed new light on the breadth and gravity of the country s crisis According to the South China Morning Post officials attributed the decline to global warming and outdated mapping techniques saying 1950s Experts meanwhile say there are more direct factors at play namely explosive economic development and poor environmental stewardship Ma Jun director of the Beijingbased Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs acknowledges that updated mapping techniques could explain some discrepancies in river estimates though he notes that the government s findings corroborate those from independent studies pollution is destroying the limited resources we have Our research has shown that in some areas especially in north China rivers are drying up or turning into seasonal rivers Ma said in a phone interview with The Verge There are several explanations for this phenomenon including deforestation and to a less certain extent climate change though Ma says the two primary catalysts are pollution and overpopulation Together they form a potentially disastrous combination China s mushrooming population has added extra strain to its limited water supply while the country s rampant industrialization has left many rivers contaminated The extent of China s pollution when more than 12000 dumped pig carcasses washed ashore in Shanghai and Jiaxing Agricultural and industrial waste has had a pronounced human impact as well contaminating water supplies in socalled cancer villages a moniker for areas with particularly high cancer rates Dead pigs and cancer villages These incidents have drawn greater attention to China s water crisis while reviving concerns over the environmental costs of unfettered economic development Chinese lawmakers however have been grappling with these issues for decades China s modern water management system dates back to the 1960s when a series of devastating floods forced Mao Zedong to commission an array of dams reservoirs and spillways Mao s infrastructure helped prevent floods but it also created ecological imbalances by blocking rivers that once flowed into the North China Plain As a result lakes and rivers in the region began drying up and farmers began depleting well supplies Population growth has only compounded China s supply issues According to a 2006 study from the China s water use has increased more than fivefold since 1949 forcing the government to take even more drastic measures In 2008 China unveiled the Three Gorges Dam a massive hydropower project that the country heralded as a marvel of engineering Today it s the largest hydropower structure in the world though it has had disastrous ecological and social effects resulting in deadly landslides and the displacement of an estimated 14 million people The government openly acknowledged these pitfalls in 2011 but it remains intent on building the SouthNorth Water Transfer Project an even grander undertaking that the New York Times described as China s most ambitious attempt to subjugate nature When completed the 62 billion initiative will divert water from China s already droughtravaged southern region to the northern Yellow and Hai rivers An emergency relief effort Ma describes the Water Transfer Project as an emergency relief effort citing the dire situation in China s northeast region though he does nt see it as out of water without this project he said but even the current volume of redirected water likely wo nt be enough to keep up with demand Instead Ma and others say China should focus on controlling demand and regulating pollution rather than reallocating its water supply Xavier Leflaive head of the water team at the OECD s Environment Directorate says China should implement marketbased reforms to encourage more responsible water usage while phasing out fertilizer subsidies to mitigate agricultural runoff He acknowledges that China is nt the only country facing these issues global water demand is expected to increase 55 percent over the next three decades and rapidly developing countries like India have faced similar crises But Beijing s unique economic and social developments add an extra layer of urgency This global trend is exacerbated in China by the speed and scale of urbanization and economic development and by a lack of strong monitoring inspection and enforcement capabilities Leflaive said in an email to The Verge sound policies laws and regulations China has implemented tougher regulations on water usage and pollutants the socalled three red lines though it remains to be seen whether they can be enforced across an expansive and fastgrowing economy punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist The good news is that the Chinese government seems willing to take a harder stance on environmental stewardship In the past Beijing has scoffed at calls to control its greenhouse emissions arguing that it should nt be punished for its own economic prosperity But Premier Li Keqiang has adopted a more environmentally conscious tone in recent weeks vowing to be more transparent about his country s ecological issues We must take the steps in advance Li said last month rather than hurry to handle these issues when they have caused a disturbance in society The premier has also promised to enforce current regulations on pollution as he explained at his debut show even greater resolve and take more vigorous efforts to clean up such pollution Li said We need to face the situation and punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist

Hunger pains Jets starving for a chance to dine at the playoff party High up on Bryan Little s cheekbone left side near his eye are the visible remnants of a fairly recent gash And now that painful reminder has a couple of partners an ugly cut across the bridge of his nose and a scrape on his upper lip that came Thursday night after a collision with Florida s Erik Gudbranson and the end boards This is the face many have seen before the face of sacrifice of commitment of the price to be paid And if this were a month from now and Little and his Winnipeg Jets teammates were to find themselves in the postseason it would be held up and glorified as the visage of a player battling in the Stanley Cup playoffs JOE BRYKSA WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Bryan Little has nt played in a postseason game since his rookie season as a pro five years ago Purchase Photo Print AP only watch as they were swept by the Rangers from the 2007 postseason Evander Kane Right now that s still a big if what with the Jets still staring up at eight teams in the Eastern Conference standings But it s also not being melodramatic to suggest it s the hunger to get to the postseason that is driving this club right now through a threegame win streak Yes there has been a hint of desperation in the collective Jets voices of late and a real evidence of it in their game And on their faces The last time I played in a playoff game was with the Chicago Wolves in my first year as a pro said Little That was five years ago Anyone that s never played in a playoff game is pretty hungry to get in there I know there s a couple of us guys who have been with Atlanta for a long time who have nt played in a playoff game last year That s my dream He s not alone Of the 28 players now with the Jets not including rookie Jacob Trouba who has yet to suit up 16 or more than half have never played in a single Stanley Cup playoff game I m just really focussed on these last games to try and change that and make playing in the playoffs a reality said Kane I really want to play in the playoffs I do nt want to go home early this year It s already been a shortened season and it would be extremely disappointing if we did nt get the job done If we get hot and we win the majority of these last games it s going to give us a good shot going into the playoffs Once you get in the playoffs anything can happen It s cliche but it s true For us it s an opportunity win and that s all I opportunity you have no chance What the Jets hope to do in the next six games is twofold 1 Lock up a playoff spot for the franchise for first time since 200607 and 2 Begin writing their own postseason history separate from the Atlanta Thrashers crew that was swept out of the first round by the New York Rangers in its one and only trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs In the past I do nt know how it was last year but usually in Atlanta this team has been way out of the playoff position this time of year said Olli Jokinen a veteran of 1084 NHL games but only six in the playoffs It s a great experience for the players and a great challenge at the same time We do nt want to be here in two weeks and say that Oh we were close That s not the mindset we have We have these couple of days off to get be ready in the playoffs once we get there This is the exciting time of the year We re happy that we re in the position that we can control where we re going Obvioisly it would be nice to have 10 more points and breathe a little easier but at the same time this team has nt been in the playoffs for a while and for a lot of the players this is a great situation Great only if they can finish the deal here Maybe that in part explains why Little returned in the third period after taking the hit from Gudbranson that opened up his nose and left some wondering if he had busted it Just for the record the Jets were winning 62 when Little exited You play every year to play for the Stanley Cup said Little That s why you play the regular season Most kids that grow up in Canada that s their dream to play in the NHL a chance at the second you ve got to make it to the playoffs and I can tell you it s been tough not being there year after year Plus I d love to see what it would be like here if there was a playoff game Little added with a sly grin I think it would be crazy Related Items Articles You can comment on most stories on

Canada Canadian Interest Rate Rules Where loan agreements are governed by Canadian law borrowers and lenders should remain alert to the range of rules contained in Canadian legislation and jurisprudence that govern the payment of interest The following is a summary of key Canadian interest rate rules and their practical implications 1 Criminal rate of interest Under section 347 of the Criminal Code Canada interest rates exceeding 60 per annum are criminal rates of interest Section 347 contains two separate offenses The first applies to those who enter into an agreement to receive interest at a criminal rate and the second to those who actually receive interest payments at a criminal rate If an agreement permits but does not require the payment of interest at a criminal rate there is no automatic violation Instead a waitandsee approach has been adopted by the courts and in these circumstances a violation will only occur where a criminal rate of interest is actually received commercial transaction to explicitly provide for interest at a rate over 60 loan agreements often include upfront arrangement commitment and other fees The broad definition of interest in the Criminal Code captures ordinary commercial interest as well as a broad range of fees fines and expenses including legal expenses Other examples include consideration payable to a lender in the form of equity kickers such as shares rights or warrants which may also be regarded as interest In 2010 the British Columbia Court of Appeal considered the appropriate treatment of a royalty payable as consideration for a loan to enable a mining development company to acquire licences for a group of properties The Court held that the royalty came within the extended definition of interest in the Criminal Code and constituted illegal interest to the extent that it exceeded 60 per annum Where the terms of a loan have been agreed upon in good faith by experienced and independently advised commercial parties the doctrine of notional severance may apply maximum of 60 The doctrine remains in the discretion of the court but can helpful for lenders since it minimizes the potential for courts to drastically reduce interest rates by severing the entire offending payment provision A provision in a loan agreement whereby the parties agree to reduce the rate of interest to a legal rate without making a new agreement can be particularly influential in helping a court allow a lender to receive the maximum legal rate of interest 2 Statement of annual rate of interest If a loan agreement provides that interest is payable at a rate or percentage per day week month or any period less than a year section 4 of the Interest Act Canada requires the agreement to also contain an express statement of the yearly rate or percentage of interest to which the other rate or percentage is equivalent except in real estate mortgages LIBOR and the US Base Rate for instance are calculated on the basis of a 360day year Under the Interest Act failure to interest over 5 per annum 3 Higher interest rate after default for loans secured by a mortgage on real property Section 8 of the Interest Act prohibits fines or penalties or interest rates that increase the charge on arrears of principal or interest secured by a mortgage of real property beyond the interest rate payable on principal money not in arrears In other words a lender can not charge a higher rate of interest on monies owing after default Prompt payment provisions in real property mortgages which reduce the rate of interest at maturity if all payments had been timely may also run afoul of section 8 4 Noncorporate borrower prepayment rights Section 10 of the Interest Act provides natural persons and certain other types of noncorporate borrowers with an automatic right of prepayment in certain circumstances where principal or interest under a closed mortgage loan are payable more than five years after the date of the loan Where section 10 applies the mortgage can be prepaid in full any time after the fiveyear interest Mortgages given by corporations and jointstock companies are expressly excluded from this prepayment right Until recently other entities that existed for business or commercial purposes were not necessarily captured by the exclusion New regulations that came into force in January 2012 however expanded the range of entities carved out from the application of section 10 Now mortgages or hypothecs granted by partnerships trusts settled for business or commercial purposes and unlimited liability corporations will not attract these automatic prepayment rights 5 Failure to include interest rate may be binding on the lender In a recent case from the Qu bec Court the Court dismissed a claim by a financial institution seeking to rectify a loan agreement that mistakenly failed to state an interest rate The parties were told to live with the mistake and the financial institution was not permitted to unilaterally amend the loan agreement to include the 695 rate that had been stipulated in the loan application The financial institution was also ordered to pay damages for having registered a and financial reputation of one of the debtors Notably the financial institution did not request the annulment of the contract which the court concluded would have been the only possible remedy As these provisions demonstrate lenders and borrowers should remain alert to the range of rules contained in Canadian legislation and case law that govern the rate of interest payable We would be pleased to assist lenders and borrowers with these matters The foregoing provides only an overview Readers are cautioned against making any decisions based on this material alone Rather a qualified lawyer should be consulted Each year the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions holds a seminar in Toronto to update both in house lawyers and outside counsel on recent activities undertaken by the Legislation and Approvals Division This change will only affect pension funds governed by Ontario law The 2015 federal budget announced a review of this rule at the federal level but

America on CBC Radio One Sirius XM Satellite Radio channel 159 and US public radio was a true smorgasbord of great conversation and great music It was entertaining it was informative it was enlightening It certainly was everything anyone in the sold out crowd could ve hoped for when they decided to plunk down their hard earned money on a ticket As Sheila Coles of CBC s The Morning Edition put it in her introduction The king And Ghomeshi was fortunate enough to bring more than enough quality artists to the show kd lang Tom Cochrane Dragonette Jim Cuddy Gary Roberts and Corb Lund each spent time conversing with the amiable host Ghomeshi s conversation with lang which came after she stunned the audience with The Valley hit a number of topics of interest After touching base on lang s induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame on Sunday Ghomeshi asked about her the challenges of her life and career I have never felt like I was fully part of anything said lang Whether it s being gay being a Buddhist being a Canadian It would be best to be independent of categories because thinking in those terms is deflating She also admitted that there was a conscious decision about stepping away from trying to be a star It takes so much energy there s so much pressure You can see that Justin Bieber s been struggling worth it Lang also drew a laugh from the crowd when Ghomeshi asked her about the pressure of performing highprofile events Helpless and Hallelujah are great songs All I have to do is sing them and that s pretty easy lang said as the crowd erupted into laughter Lang returned to the stage later in the evening to lend a helping hand when Bahamas performed Lost In The Light While much of the night s conversation was light Ghomeshi s chat with Cochrane had some serious moments as they discussed his involvement with charitable organizations like World Vision Cochrane who will be presented with the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award on Sunday spoke of the importance of accepting the honour It means I can thank some people for inspiring me said Cochrane If you get up there thinking I deserve this award then you probably do nt deserve the award Cochrane

and reveals that the crop contains a startling level of toxic chemicals and just is nt as nutritious as natural corn The study was reportedly run by Profit Pro and is called the 2012 Corn Comparison Report It was published recently on the Moms Across America March to Label GMOs website The group states on their website that they wish to raise awareness and support Moms with solutions to eat GMO Free as we demand GMO labeling locally and nationally simultaneously They are planning on organizing several nationwide marches this year against GMOs The study gives the results of an educationbased consulting company s comparison of corn types and what the study shows is that genetically modified foods may be more hazardous than once thought Not only does the study show that the crop is hazardous to health it further shows that it is far less nutritious than traditional organic corn America website the report was provided by a representative for De Dell Seed Company an Ontariobased farm that boasts it is Canada s only nonGMO corn seed company Honeycutt says she was floored after reading the study and said that The claims that There is no difference between GMO corn and non GMO corn are false According to tests run by Profit Pro GMO corn contains various elements which are absent from traditional corn including chlorides formaldehyde and glyphosate and they are present to the tune of 60 ppm 200pm and 13 ppm respectively Accordng to Honeycutt the United States Environmental Protection Agency mandates the level of glyphosate in American drinking water must not exceed 07 ppm adding that organ damage in some animals has been linked to glyphosate exposure exceeding 01 ppm Glyphosate draws out the vital nutrients of living things and GMO corn is covered with it adds Honeycutt further noting that the nutritional benefits rampant in natural corn are the study in the samples used nonGMO corn is alleged to have 437times the amount of calcium of genetically modified versions and 56times the level of magnesium and 7times the level of manganese This study takes a further step to the recent study run by Professor GillesEric S ralini the French scientist who ran lifetime tests on GM corn and Roundup on rats where he showed that levels of Roundup Monsanto s herbicide of which its main chemical ingredient is glyphosate currently considered safe can cause mammary tumors and multiple organ damage kidney and liver These studies also come as a decision on Capitol Hill to approve an annual agriculture appropriations bill has been passed despite the provision within the act which contained a rider that frees GMO corporations such as the multibilliondollar Monsanto Company from liability Dubbed the Monsanto Protection Act this provision was written by a lawmaker who has lobbied for Monsanto and it states that biotech companies wo nt need federal approval to test are unknown It seems that the advertisement by Monsanto for Roundup featured

told a meeting of his EU colleagues that it was important to have a coherent plan in which member states had a greater level of participation in such missions Eight Irish military personnel are involved in an EU training mission of the Malian Armed Forces It is hoped the mission will help restore the country s territorial integrity while ensuring human rights are respected and the civilian population is protected At a meeting of EU defence ministers in Luxembourg last night Mr Shatter said there was a clear commitment from the EU that it would maintain its engagement with Mali for as long as was necessary after militants linked to alQaeda were pushed back by French which it is hoped will give legitimacy to the new government Mr Shatter said he believed that the EU training mission would remain in the country for some time He said there was going to be a clear need for a peacekeeping mission with a UN mandate in Mali Mr Shatter said should that happen the Government would give serious consideration to members of the Irish Defence Forces participating The gangs are involved mainly in street thefts and shoplifting during the day and then focusing on customers in nightclubs

owners of the mobiles knew their IMEI international mobile equipment identity numbers A mobile owner can access the IMEI number by keying in 06 and the owner is advised to send the number to a

adventures however and quickly established a double break cushion then served out the first set on her first opportunity when Li sank a return into the net after another wellplaced serve The pair

economy is recovering You see it longterm trendline 25 percent You see it in the housing market characterized as surging with prices up in every major city on average 9 percent higher than a year ago You see it in the stock market as high as its ever been With the release Friday of the job numbers for April you see it in the unemployment numbers For a change both monthly surveys of employers and of households agree the economy added at least 165000 jobs last month and 114000 more jobs than had previously been reported for February and March But then how is it you may ask that the official unemployment rate known as U3 in government parlance barely budged and remains at 75 percent How is it that our own far more inclusive measure of unemployment and underemployment the U7 is down a tick but still weighs in at a whopping 16 percent U7 includes everyone in the government s U3 looked for one in the past 4 weeks It also adds everyone who said they wanted one had nt looked in the past 4 weeks but had in the past year These people are included in the government s most inclusive statistic U6 But we also add people who had nt looked in the past year but still said they wanted a job and would take one Finally we add people working parttime but say they are looking for fulltime work like consultants I know who may have worked only one hour in the week the government survey taker came calling but are still tallied as officially employed Here is my Solman Scale breakdown of the numbers for April How can it be that were we to compare today s number to unemployment as reckoned in the past by adding working age Americans who would probably be unemployed but are instead drawing disability more than 8 million or in prison more than 2 II highs See our NewsHour report on the undercounting of unemployment How can it be that that in a recovery and by the narrowest U3 definition 9 percent of Latinos 132 percent of AfroAmericans and 24 percent of teenagers are unemployed meaning they looked for work in the past week but did nt find even one hour s worth How can it be finally that 44 million Americans continue to be out of work for 27 weeks or more and for those 55 or older it takes a year on average to find a job That s the topic of our segment on PBS NewsHour on the Friday evening broadcast as we introduce viewers to a range of capable earnest and articulate

Fantasia in a box She s a trained vocalist who can push the envelope into many different types of music Saying No to the 401k No matter what fund companies do Americans just do nt seem to think with urgency about their 401k balance And fund companies are doing a lot The problem seems simple and in some ways like it should already have been solved Given the advent of IRSsanctioned taxdeferred savings plans like IRAs and 401ks the opportunity for automatic enrollment in these plans the elimination of most companysponsored defined benefit plans and the threat to Social Security who would nt want to do all they can to make sure they are prepared for their retirement Yet fund company CEOs say that increasing the number of people directing a percentage of their paycheck to retirement funds and figuring out how to persuade employees that increasing the amount they divert to their retirement plans each year will pay off in the long run remains a huge industry challenge Many are failing to do that According to commentary from an oftquoted Merrill Lynch Help2Retire webcast half of eligible employees younger 401k programs Of those who do 40 percent do nt put in enough to take advantage of the employer s matching program Speaking on that webcast John Pelletier director of the Center for Financial Literacy at Champlain College in Burlington Vt said If you re lucky enough to get a job where you have a 401k and you have an employer match I always start by asking a question If I could guarantee you 100 percent return would you take it And everybody says Yes What if I could guarantee you a 200 percent return would you take it Everybody says Yes But what the statistics show is that over 40 percent of people do nt take advantage of their employer match And some employers match 50 cents on the dollar a dollar for a dollar or 2 for a dollar And that s guaranteed return money Things like companybased retirement plans are now almost gone and who said Education programs are one of the few tools fund companies and plan sponsors have at their disposal to convince the American workforce of the necessity of saving for retirement They have found that many workers want to contribute to their retirement plans but need help figuring out which funds would best serve them based on the number of years they have left before retirement and their risk tolerance The responsibility of providing retirement education to investors lies with the employer and its plans sponsor Most employers and plan sponsors endorse more aggressive literacy campaigns designed to entice their employees to invest said Michael Falcon head of retirement at JP Morgan Asset Management However federal regulation limits what plan sponsors can say when it comes to providing investment education Employers are eager to get information out to people but they want to make sure it s good objective information Falcon said They are wary of the appearance of a conflict of interest and the lack of safe harbor in Schwab has been leveraging outside firms such as Morningstar to provide participants in its plans with investment guidance in a way that helps to eliminate any conflict of interest Chandoha said a great deal of change in the past decade has moved most 401k plan providers away from offering only their investment management company s funds within plans which represented a conflict of interest Open architecture offering funds from a variety of fund families is now the industry standard For instance if Schwab is running a company s 401k acting as a plan sponsor and an investment manager it offers mutual funds from other companies within the plan Companies and plan sponsors are demanding more open architecture to reduce that kind of conflict of interest Chandoha said The increased implementation of auto enrollment and reenrollment plans is another way the industry is pushing employees to start investing in their 401k plans The idea is to put the onus on the employee to opt out of contributing to a pop up so that existing employees as opposed to just new employees are also automatically enrolled in their company s 401k plans With companies that are doing this we are seeing an uptick in contributions participation diversification of investment and enrollment in target date funds Falcon said Once an employee is enrolled and even if investment guidance remains a challenge target date mutual funds are serving as a bridge to help plan participants get a handle on their optimal asset mix and risk tolerance Many people in 401k plans do nt have the time or do nt feel knowledgeable about making investment decisions or are just not interested in it Chandoha said Target date funds use a diversified approach allocating an employees portfolio to a variety of funds structured in a way that as the person reaches retirement age more of the portfolio is moved from equities into fixed income The idea is that the easier you make it for employees to invest their When all else fails or at least when the most simple tools at a fund company s disposal are not enough there is cuttingedge economic research as a tool Allianz Global Investors Center for Behavioral Finance is exploring investor behavior and concepts like framing to persuade people to save and invest more For example how to turn the conversation away from investment return and toward income as an individual ages can make for a more convincing case to stay on track with retirement contributions We go beyond product and look at how we get people to make the right decisions about how and when to invest said Elizabeth Corley global CEO of Allianz Global Investors Given the inability to solve the savings riddle it has not been welcome news within the fund industry that the White House s recently released 2014 budget proposal includes measures to limit retirement plan tax advantages As the government continues to look for ways to reduce the deficit one proposal would prohibit taxpayers from retirement savings is more than the amount necessary to provide the maximum annuity allowed for taxqualified definedbenefit plans currently an annual benefit of 205000 beginning at 62 According to the Treasury Department s Green Book the maximum permitted accumulation for a person 62 today is about 34 million Another budget proposal would only allow contributions into a retirement plan to be reduced from taxable income up to the level of the 28 percent tax bracket Fund companies have expressed anxiety over and distaste for the budget proposals on many grounds though the chance of these retirement tax reforms being enacted is not high even according to tax experts who believe there is a good case to be made for reducing some retirement tax breaks The problem is that we have all become habituated to the idea that we do nt save enough and the government should subsidize saving through taxadvantaged retirement plans said Edward Kleinbard a professor of law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff of Congress debate to have over the level at which the government should stop offering preferential tax treatment to upperincome savers Kleinbard said But the administration would need to explain why there is too much of good thing when it comes to retirement savings he said And it would be a difficult case to make even to middle of the road politicians The budget is a wish list for the administration Kleinbard said It s not exactly a selfless appeal from investment managers on the retirement bully pulpit After all the more assets in retirement plans the fund company s primary asset base the more fee revenue the fund companies and plan sponsors generate Those retirementplan fees came under fire again in a recent Frontline examination of the market Yet it is hard to argue with the logic that it s in somone s best interest to start contributing to a retirement plan as early as possible to maximize the savings

just beautiful to listen to it is increasingly being used in surprising ways Can a nightingale s song help you pass an exam or a blackbird s twittering encourage you to open a bank account Sound experts are using it to do both They argue the positive results speak for themselves even though researchers say there is little hard scientific evidence to show people respond positively to birds singing Most support for the theory is anecdotal So what are the innovative ways it is being used Homework Far too often noise can make it hard to concentrate be it a loud television loud traffic or loud people But audio experts say certain sounds can make it easier to focus and they include birds singing Find out more What makes birdsong so special is that it relaxes people physically but stimulates Business and chairman of noise consultancy The Sound Agency Birdsong creates a state he calls body relaxed mind alert People find birdsong relaxing and reassuring because over thousands of years they have learnt when the birds sing they are safe it s when birds stop singing that people need to worry Birdsong is also nature s alarm clock with the dawn chorus signalling the start of the day so it stimulates us cognitively Treasure has used birdsong to develop a free smartphone app called Study It claims to be a productivityboosting soundscape to listen to while you work It can help focus improve cognition and reduce tiredness Treasure argues It s also designed to mask background noise that can disturb concentration particularly conversation The effect of birdsong on our brains is being researched by Eleanor Ratcliffe She is carrying out a threeyear study looking at how natural sounds can improve mood and attention for her PhD in Environmental Psychology at the University of Surrey The Wildlife Trust We need to find out if how and why birdsong can be of psychological benefit Many people believe it is she says Postmeal slump Birdsong in poetry The nightingale has probably the most celebrated song with John Keats describing the bird pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy in his 1819 Ode to a Nightingale Samuel Taylor Coleridge s 1798 poem The Nightingale reads And hark the Nightingale begins its song Most musical most melancholy bird so his song should make all Nature lovelier and itself be loved like Nature William Wordsworth wrote the skylark s babbling song dost pour upon the world a flood of harmony in his 1805 verse To a Skylark In the science world it s known as postprandial somnolence but in the everyday world it s commonly known as the postmeal slump It s the period after a meal when blood sugar levels drop causing you to get sleepy likely solutions researchers are looking into what can lift people out of this soporific state after lunch Birdsong has been found to work they say An experiment at a primary school in Liverpool run by sonic branding company Condiment Junkie Glyndwr University and architects Nightingale Associates found that playing pupils a soundscape of birdsong and other natural sounds made them more alert and better able to concentrate after their lunch break The key to the most effective audio was lack of repetition say those involved Birdsong works because it s stochastic made up of lots of random sounds There is no repeating rhythm or pattern to focus on It does nt get stuck in your head and annoy you but it does nt lull you to sleep and bore you either says Russell Jones from Condiment Junkie I m not sure there is any other sound that can do what birdsong does It should be part of the soundtrack to everyone s day along the corridors of Alder Hey Children s Hospital in Liverpool among the noise of everyday hospital life you will hear birdsong Patients recorded the sound of birds in a local park as part of a project with the Foundation for Creative Technology FACT and awardwinning wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson Amsterdam s Schiphol Airport uses birdsong in a quiet lounge where people can relax before their flight Along with other calming methods birdsong is played through speakers hidden in real trees Last month the airport was voted the third best in the world at the World Airport Awards and last year 95 of passengers rated it as good or excellent according to Schiphol s own figures Such projects try to use native birdsongs as they think they will be most successful Ratcliffe is looking at responses to different birdsong and depending on the outcome it s a possibility that in the future people could be prescribed certain bits of birdsong to suit their individual needs It would be nice to say to people says The National Trust suggests people listen to birdsong for a few minutes a day to combat low moods Sound expert Julian Treasure agrees It resets the ears allows us to hear properly Most of us walk around with our ears switched off because so much noise is unpleasant Unlike so many other sounds there s no maximum exposure to birdsong Business Treasure worked on one project in Colombia to rebrand a bank As well as the visual side of things a soundscape was also created that included birdsong The rebranding resulted in a dramatic uplift in people opening new accounts and customer approval ratings rose from 64 to 90 in just six months says Treasure BP also used birdsong when research revealed toilets in its petrol stations were having a negative effect on customers feelings about the BP brand A strategy was drawn up to improve the toilets including among other things a birdsong soundscape The aim was to create a mental connection

Torontobased Dundee Corp TSX TDCA Stock Forum He was speaking to the Association for Mineral Exploration BC in Vancouver May 10 2013 I am part of a brokerage firm that depends on the Toronto Stock Exchange We are at a point now where there is an impediment to economic growth job creation innovation and business formation And everybody has forgotten about why a stock exchange was put in place A stock exchange was put in place to allow junior companies individuals to come up with new ideas be innovative and be able to raise money All we do now when we do that is we raise money for the legal profession I do nt think we should be doing that I think we should be raising money to spend it in the ground part of the Toronto Stock Exchange we call it the TSX Venture Exchange most of the people in Toronto caught a disease called BreX and they are still looking for the next BreX They do nt know what to do about it so they put in all kinds of rules Investors in BreX Minerals lost about 3 billion in 1997 when its socalled Busang gold find in Indonesia was found to be a scam I was quoted on something called SinoForest Corp TSX TTRE Stock Forum where the regulators took a company totally wiped it out shareholders got zero billions of dollars were lost Investors in SinoForest were left stranded when the Ontario Securities Commission suspended trading in the ChineseCanadian timber firm in August 2011 This was after a short seller alleged that the company was a Ponzi scheme causing the shares to collapse The company is being taken over by the debt holders because the Ontario Securities was part of the underwriting of SinoForest So I had a senior person at the office of the Ontario Securities Commission every day almost for months In the end they told us that we did all our due diligence correctly no problems They congratulated us We were told that they were proud of us that we had all the right stuff It made me feel good Except that billions of dollars of the equity was wiped out It was wiped out because the Globe and Mail newspaper came back from a visit and they said we could nt find any place where SinoForest owned the land where the supposed trees were Well of course not In China nobody owns the land It is the state that owns the land You rent the land from the state On that basis they put the company out of business The point that I made at that time I was asked do we need more regulation And I said only do we need better regulation We need a better stock exchange and better things of that nature The speaker is Jock played by the popular Australian

re wondering why you have nt had a chance to get off your couch this month then congratulations you re officially in TV finale hell May is one of the busiest times in the TV schedule because it is the end of the traditional television season It s also one of the crucial sweeps months where programmers jockey for eyeballs to get high ratings that will help determine advertising rates With the stakes higher than ever networks traditionally blow their budgets on killer finales The good news is that Fonzie will not try to jump over a shark as in past season finales stars such as Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane on The Simpsons or Hilary Duff on the season finale of Two and a Half Men It can be a stressful month because you re planning where to put your best programming to compete with the other networks says Barbara Williams senior vicepresident of content for Shaw Media which includes Global Television and 19 other specialty channels But certainly it s a huge month for us and there is enormous pressure Advertisers are also keen to place their products during season finales since audience share can typically bump from 5 to 10 per cent says Judy Davey executive vicepresident of media buying company ZenithOptimedia In the US sweep dates include November February May and July There is a lot of competition for eyeballs so not everything as a season finale spikes says Davey If it s

audiences are measured by BBM Canada which uses a diary system for smaller markets and an electronic device called a portable people meter in larger markets such as Toronto and Montreal The meter is worn by the viewer and it picks up signals from TV sets that are translated into data on what those people are watching at all times About 4500 households across Canada are part of the sample group For the smaller markets we typically send out diaries little booklets that people can jot down what they re watching in the fall and spring says Tom Jenks spokesperson for BBM Canada a nonprofit organization made up of advertisers and broadcasters Williams meanwhile says the war for eyeballs never ends After networks have served their best dishes in May they ve still got to have something left over for the summer months now and people want to see high quality shows says Williams But that means at the end of the day it s the viewers who win After a brilliant academic career in music in which professor Lois Choksy wrote six nonfiction texts she retired and turned her imagination to another genre fiction It was something she had always wanted to do so she wrote her first fictional potboiler and took it to her big publisher who had released her previous professional books They were nt in the least interested in my fiction she recalls still with surprise They said get an agent An editor sent her a constructive critique of her book and Choksy realized she would have to find her own voice and learn more about writing in her chosen area romantic suspense At retirement age she went back to school to take university courses to learn about dialogue plot arcs pacing and cliffhanger chapters none of which was necessary to write books about music After attending an intensive workshop in Oregon she learned that her way of writing must involve the reader through stronger characters she said All of Choksy s current books to date have strong women characters in them The music professor chose the pen name of Blair McDowell and she set out to grab the hearts of her biggest reading market women She will read from her latest book Sonata set in Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast

country she loves Her next Delighting in Your Company 2012 springs from a remote island setting in the Caribbean where Choksy has owned a place for 45 years The island evokes myths and brims with the history of slavery and this has been incorporated into a ghost story around a romantic character But nothing that I see any place else is as beautiful as through the trees to the Strait of Georgia from her porch at her bed and breakfast business near Gibsons The denouement of her latest Sonata takes place in a cabin in Smuggler s Cove and her cast of characters includes a halfAsian heritage

and 500000 with growing ongoing expenses for bait fuel maintenance and crew their ultimate and repeated demand was for greater clarity in the industry At each meeting the fishermen demanded an opening of the books throughout the supply chain to show where the money goes from the wharf to the plate That ll be the job of a panel promised by the fisheries ministers of the three Maritime provinces last week A promise that saw fishermen return to the water without an increase in catch prices So where does the money go We have eliminated the middleman and we ve still suffered significant losses for the past two years Osborne Burke manager of Victoria Cooperative Fisheries Limited said Thursday Anybody who thinks there s a fortune being made out there I d like them to walk in my shoes In 1957 the fishermen of northern Cape Breton banded together Cooperative Fisheries Limited expanded over the decades to become not only a buyer but a processor and exporter and after the decline of the groundfish fishery turned most of its efforts to crab and lobster Run by a volunteer board of fishermen all its books are open and its members receive annual statements They re also told a rare occurrence in the industry what they ll get paid for their catch before the season opens This year it s 4 dollars a pound for marketsized lobster We made it very clear that we ll try at that price for the first couple of days and if it s not viable we ll have to adjust the price down said Burke And realistically that s what s going to happen A thousand pounds of lobster at the wharf does nt end up a thousand pounds sold to the plate About half the lobster the coop buys between Dingwall and Gabarus goes into the live the lobsters have to be handled repeatedly as they re sized and sorted and sorted again at the Neils Harbour fish plant and there are losses all along the way because of mortality and weak lobsters The other half the small and the imperfectly formed that goes to processing only yields from 3035 per cent of its landed weight in salable meat So if you pay 4000 for a thousand pounds of lobster you re actually paying 12000 said Burke After shipping it out the plant door processors and exporters of live lobster compete with one another in a crowded market There s no formula out there for price said Roger Cameron owner of Cameron s Seafoods in Halls Harbour Kings County They come to me and tell me what they re willing to pay I have to tell them if I can meet that Cameron 50 is paying about the same price for lobster as he was paid as a aboard an 18foot skiff before heading to school each morning in Port Hood Cape Breton He buys live lobster grades and packages them at his plant in the Annapolis Valley and within 3550 hours they re on a plane to markets in Europe and Asia Let s say you buy 50000 pounds of live lobster for a set price and then someone else sells 50000 pounds for cheaper into the market said Cameron Are you going to hold out and let them die Or are you going to sell them at a loss Having grown up fishing Cameron said he appreciates the financial stresses on fishermen and their growing costs but with markets flooded there is nt much money being made by anyone It s an industry that does nt understand itself very well he said Whether seafood wholesalers in Asia Europe and the United States are willing to open their books to the panel promised by the fisheries ministers remains to be seen in the industry may be more manageable Meanwhile Doyle is paying 25000 a year on his licence and another 10000 annually for his boat Then there s 10000 during his twomonth season for bait 4500 for fuel and 14000 for crew His big diesel motor is 7400 hours into an estimated life expectancy of 10000 hours it ll cost 45000 to replace Then there s licensing fees wharf fees and a thousand other costs that pile up He expects to catch 15000 to 20000 pounds of lobster during his season He s one of the lucky ones He runs a convenience

on May 20 2013 Photo by J Scott ApplewhiteAP The comprehensive immigration reform bill passed a huge hurdle on Tuesday night with the Senate Judiciary Committee voting 135 for passage out of the committee and on to the senate floor Included in the provision were 10500 E3 visas for Irish recipients which will allow Irish natives to renew non immigrant visas every two years The visas known as Schumer visas after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York who has been their major proponent would transform Irish immigration to America Up to 50000 Irish undocumented would be covered by the legalization provision in the bill Republican senator Charles Grassley had attempted to strip the Irish E3 visas from the bill but failed to get any support Three Republicans sided with ten Democrats to pass the bill giving it a very strong 135 majority which will boost its last several weeks in June Democrats dropped an amendment allowing gay spouses to become legal through their partner s green card a contentious issue that threatened to scuttle the bill All ten Democrats could have forced the vote through but to have done so would have ended the bill Senator Schumer stated As much as it pains me I can not support this amendment if it will bring down the bill Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has signalled that he will push for passage of the bill put together by four senators from both sides The Gang of Eight has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward So far I m told that the Judiciary Committee has not in any fundamental way undone the agreement reached by the eight senators so I m hopeful we ll be able to get a bill we can pass here in the Senate he stated A separate bill will likely be introduced in the House where its prospects are still uncertain successful senate negotiations If both bills pass then a conference will be called to work out the differences both houses will vote on the compromise and if it is passed President Obama will sign it into law LIMERICK people have the third highest level of disposable income in the country after Dubliners and people living in Kildare That s according to findings just published by the

in eastwest trades will force carriers to further reduce speeds according to an analysis by Drewry The firm said it believes ocean carriers are currently losing money on the route and surplus capacity is likely to remain a problem There are 31 ships with a capacity of 10000 twentyfoot equivalentunit TEU or larger due for delivery this year but Drewry said there is nt a corresponding growth in demand Either more vessels will have to be laid up or further slow steaming introduced Drewry said The latter is the most logical particularly as it was difficult to justify throughout most of last year due to freight rates being so high Either more vessels will have to be laid up or further slow steaming introduced Drewry Currently Drewry found there is a wide variation in speeds among carriers Speeds knots for G6 AllianceLoop 4 to 222 knots for Maersk LineAE2 and variation among companies for service between Asia and West Coast North America was similar Drewry said carriers do not seem to get a significant rate premium for faster service and schedule optimisation seems to be more important First bond issue in Singapore offshore yuan market by HSBC Singapore The offshore yuan market is

Take all the human innovation and invention and ingenuity from the dawn of time right up till five minutes ago Take every tool every device every technique and every technology From the first pointed stick ever picked up the from the ground by a caveman to the latest Tesla electric car What is the driving force behind these developments Now this is not an original idea I do nt exactly recall where I read this for the first time But I think it was in one of JM Roberts excellent singlevolume histories of the world In it he suggests that the human strivings that lead to epochal inventions such as agriculture electricity or the Internet are motivated not as you might expect by visions of a better life or longevity or convenience Instead Roberts suggests they are singleminded human determination to reduce the randomness in our existence For instance the life of the huntergatherer is of utmost unpredictability Who knows when a goat will offer itself for hunting or a coconut palm for gathering Or both for some appam stew Agriculture brought stability and predictability to their food supplies Similarly ancient mariners developed navigation so that they could actually reach somewhere And not flounder about on some strange jungle shore with no baggage and no food Though Air France is working very hard at returning us to those beastly days And thus human beings over the ages have tried to constantly increase the predictability of every sphere of homo sapien activity from manufacturing and medicine to meteorology and shortformat cricketing tournaments But what does all this have to with office culture and cubicle life Or have I simply been wasting the last three minutes of your glorious Saturday morning Earlier this month consumer goods company Procter and Gamble PampG announced that it to run the company In 2009 Lafley stepped down after handing over the control room to Bob McDonald a handpicked successor At the time the transfer was referred to as a textbook case of transition management Lafley was said to have not only picked a successor but also left behind an internal system at PampG to pick and groom leaders for the future Lafley it appeared had left the company futureproof Now Lafley is back and there are already reports of a new restructuring at PampG that will turn around the company and help identify a better successor For PampG s sake I hope it works But the story exposes some of the modern workplace s misplaced insouciance that it can manage all randomness Business schools business textbooks and business gurus all give us the impression that most if not every element of the workplace and business can be reduced to deterministic rules Follow the rules execute the prescribed actions and you will get your desired outcomes that the human beings involved become irrelevant This is fine so far as the models are extended to mathematical things such as simple banking supply chains information systems and so on But extend this thinking to concepts such as leadership and suddenly you re tapdancing on razorthin ice To me the very idea of a leadership grooming system is ridiculous It seems a wishful futile attempt to mitigate all kinds of inestimably random things It is also a reflection of the modern organization s insistence that the process is superior to the person Apple is greater than Steve Jobs Virgin is greater than Richard Branson Amazon is greater than Jeff Bezos But what if they are nt What if PampG can never replace Lafley What if there is simply no way of using all your confounded obsession with controlling randomness to cleave the leader from the legions And even if your leadership grooming programme does throw up some brilliant young managers what about the external with Winston Churchill what if you appoint a great peacetime CEO for a brutal wartime scenario But there are other randomnesses besides leadership as well The backalleys of marketing are littered with dead brands that got great focus group feedback And yet managers continue to obsess over these tools that give them the sense that human emotional response can be managed Of course this obsession extends to all spheres of life Economists politicians diplomats and religious leaders all function with unstinting faith in their own models of the universe The general public is little better Each generation likes to think that it has tamed randomness a little better than the previous one And then something falls apart Cubiclenama takes a weekly look at pleasures and perils of corporate life Your comments are welcome at

challenging the tax department s contention that tax should have been deducted at source by the Indian arm on money it paid as royalty to its parent Photo Bloomberg Updated Fri May 31 2013 11 22 PM IST New Delhi In a setback to Indian unit of Nokia Corp the commissioner of income tax appeals has rejected the phone handset maker s appeal against a Rs2000 crore tax demand in a case relating to royalties on software downloaded on devices manufactured at the Finnish company s Chennai plant The decision is likely to lead to a new round of litigation at different levels by Nokia against the tax demand Nokia is disappointed by the decision of the commissioner of income tax appeals and will now examine all options open to it These include taking the case back to the Delhi high court the company said in a March with the tax demand for five years starting from 200607 in one of several tax disputes involving a foreign company in India Nokia had initially approached the high court in March challenging the tax department s contention that tax should have been deducted at source by the Indian arm on money it paid as royalty to its parent The tax demand said that Nokia India should have withheld 10 TDS tax deducted at source for royalty payments made against the supply of software by the parent company The high court had first stayed the order and then asked Nokia to approach the commissioner of income tax appeals In addition to legal action being pursued in India the ministry of finance in Finland has launched the mutual agreement procedure MAP with its counterpart in India under the bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement DTAA between the two countries to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution Nokia said MAP is a provision under DTAA that allows for the resolution of disputes involving double taxation its interests the statement said BM Singh former chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes said the dispute resolution will be a long process It is only the first step and Nokia has the option of approaching the appellate tribunal and the high court Also if a MAP is initiated under the DTAA then competent authorities of both the countries will have to sit together and figure out how much tax should be paid in which country he said Nokia reiterated that it was in full compliance with Indian laws as well as the bilaterally negotiated tax treaty between the governments of India and Finland Nokia will defend itself vigorously in this case and against any other Indian tax allegations using all channels available the statement said Court

drug pricing profiteering call for price cuts Rema Nagarajan Over a hundred experts in chronic myeloid leukaemia CML a kind of blood cancer have criticised the high prices of cancer drugs and have argued for the need to lower the prices of cancer drugs to allow more patients to afford them TNN May 31 2013 0655 PM IST Recently the Supreme Court of India denied a patent on imatinib to Novartis allowing cheaper generics to be Read More NEW DELHI Over a hundred experts in chronic myeloid leukaemia CML a kind of blood cancer have criticised the high prices of cancer drugs and have argued for the need to lower the prices of cancer drugs to allow more patients to afford them Selected CML experts from all over the world were invited to contribute to this article including two from India Dr Hemant Malhotra of SMS College Jaipur and Dr Pankaj Malhotra of PGI Chandigarh The the jacking up of the price of bread in a famine or like raising commodity prices after natural disasters Among the experts is Dr Brian Druker key researcher behind the development of imatinib a revolutionary drug to treat CML We believe the unsustainable drug prices in CML and cancer may be causing harm to patients Advocating for lower drug prices is a necessity to save the lives of patients who can not afford them stated the doctors in their editorial which was published in the journal of the American Society of Hematology Blood Recently the Supreme Court of India denied a patent on imatinib to Novartis allowing cheaper generics to be available to CML patients in India and other parts of the world that depend on India for generic medicines Authorship in the article was by invitation only Pankaj and I were invited to be part of this article and I believe that every oncologist and every doctor across all specialties is interested in getting the patient cured with the least possible morbidity said Dr Hemant Malhotra when contacted by the Times of India Dr Tarun Kumar Dutta of JIPMER in Pondicherry also stated that he was sure that every doctor felt the prices were too high and would like to have the prices reduced so that they could treat more patients Dr Malhotra pointed out that while the situation was acute in the US in India several patients especially the poor were getting access through differential drug pricing or subsidies offered by many multinational pharma companies However India is estimated to have over 2 lakh CML patients with 30000 being added every year A free drug program like the one run by Novartis covers only a fraction of these patients through doctors they choose The central andor the state government should buy the drug in bulk from a good generic drug manufacturer and provide it free for CML patients suggested Dr Malhotra as a way to increase access to treatment According to the editorial of the 12 drugs approved by the FDA for various cancer indications in 2012 drug prices have almost doubled from a decade ago from an average of 5000 per month to more than 10000 per month it stated Several of the doctors who were coauthors of the editorial have done research work and clinical trials with drug companies but they felt that though they supported a healthy pharma industry they felt that the prices being charged were way above what was needed to maintain healthy profits The experts have raised the question what determines a morally justifiable just price for cancer drug A reasonable drug price should maintain healthy pharmaceutical company profits without being viewed as profiteering making profit by unethical methods like raising commodity prices after natural disasters It goes on to expose how pricing had no connection to the actual cost of developing a drug The original imatinib price of 30000 in 2001 when it was released is said to have reflected the cost of development with the then Novartis CEO justifying it saying that it was imperative for healthy profit high price it was thought to be a worthwhile and profitable price despite numerous appeals by patients to lower the price The doctors point out that instead of lowering the price it actually increased from 30000 to 92000 per year despite the fact that all research costs were accounted for in the original price and despite the fact that new indications were developed and approved by the FA for the drug and the number of CML patients taking imatinib had dramatically increased Hopes that the fundamentals of a free market economy and market competition will settle cancer drug prices at lower levels have not been fulfilled All 5 TKIs tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for CML have annual price ranges of 92138000 in the US twice the prices in Europe where governments bargain for bulk prices pointed out the editorial It goes on to detail how collusive behavior could maintain high prices over extended periods of time despite competitive markets thus representing a form of collective monopoly and how companies engage in paytodelay deals to companies get extensions on patents so that they can indulge in monopoly pricing longer Though CML prevalence worldwide is estimated to be about 12 15 million patients based on sales it is estimated that less than 25 are receiving imatinib with an additional 5 getting the drug through the drug companies free drug programme stated the editorial That still leaves 75 without access to the drug and the doctors squarely blame the astronomical prices for the lack of access to treatment which could allow CML patients to live closetonormal life spans as long as they have

ministry on Wednesday advised Indian students seeking admission in two Californiabased universities to defer their departure till it gets a response from the US government on the issue Hydro projects causing degeneration of hill ecology CAG Shimla The hydropower projects in Himachal Pradesh in private and public sectors are not only gobbling up forests but also damaging natural resources the Comptroller and Auditor General of India CAG has found The compensatory afforestation by the state is highly deficient as 58 percent of the testchecked hydropower projects reported no afforestation at all the CAG said in its recent report It pointed out that lack of regreening of hills poses severe hazards both to natural ecology and stabilisation of hill slopes A total of 559 runofriver hydro projects with an aggregate generation capacity of 10131 MW were allotted to independent power producers from November 1991 to January 2012 Till March last year says the CAG 55 projects have been commissioned and the remaining are under execution An audit found that 12 companies have deposited the funds for compensatory afforestation but it was not carried out at all in seven projects Out of while in three projects it was between 64 and 81 percent it said The plantation survival in Barseu and Manglad projects was 90 and 100 percent whereas it was between 40 and 60 percent in the MalanaI LuniII and Upper Awa projects The MalanaI project which has already been commissioned had acquired 61 hectares of forest area in Kullu district for the project The company got clearance to axe 990 trees As compensatory afforestation the government was supposed to plant 529000 saplings on behalf of the company but only 336500 were planted it said The company had deposited Rs14337 lakh with the government for compensatory afforestation in November 1998 The plantation said the CAG was highly deficient posing severe hazards both for natural ecology and stabilisation of hill slopes It also found that one power producer Manjhal in Chamba district out of the 16 operational projects selected for testcheck was not ensuring minimum flow of water downstream The ensure minimum flow of 15 percent water downstream throughout the year including the lean season from November to March for survival of aquatic flora and fauna and riparian rights According to the CAG in three Manjhal SarbariII and TarellaIII commissioned projects there was no provision of realtime continuous water outflow measurement which is mandatory as per the government s hydropower policy The CAG asked the government to ensure that hydropower projects do not result in an adverse impact on the environment According to forest department estimates over 9000 hectares of forest land have so far been diverted to nonforest use Of this 7000 hectares were used for hydel projects Environmentalist RS Negi who heads the Him Lok Jagriti Manch a people s movement against upcoming hydro projects in Kinnaur district told The hydro projects are destructive not only to the rivers but also to traditional water channels Before allocating any new project in the entire Himalayan region that falls in seismic zoneIV and

HimachalBlind following is always a worst Hence in the best interest of state and its environment stoppage is the requirement of time It is also a fact that we have completely failed in replantation drive what soever figure we may put forward The Cag report makes precisely the same points and voices the same concerns recommendations that were made in the Shukla Committee report submitted to the HP High Court in June 2010 The state govt had under pressure from the hydropower lobby predictably opposed the findings of the report but it appears that the matter has made no headway towards implementation even in the High CourtThe Central govt too is sleeping over it We are running out of time Is it time to file another PIL on the basis of the CAG report this both the Centre and the

Gobichettipalayambased Provimi Products introduced Herboliv a plant growth promoter and wild animal repellent spray to solve the mananimal conflict GV Sudarshan Director of Provimi says the formula helps control intrusion of wild animals into agricultural fields and also aids crop growth The Forest College and Research Institute at Mettupalayam is testing the product Business Line meanwhile spoke to a couple of farmers who have been using this spray for about a month now Velusamy a small farmer residing at Mundirimudaku Odanthurai Panchayat in Mettupalayam says not a day passes without intrusion of some animal or the other into his field Velusamy s farm is located just about 1500 feet away from the Ooty hills It is very close to the forest I have been living and cultivating banana in this 25 acre plot for more than 8 years now Intrusion of animals such as deer bison and They just stray from the forest anytime of the day and pull out the plantlet We use sticks beat drums to ward them off The area is fenced by electric lines to ensure that these animals do not invade the cultivated area We have to keep a watch though as they tend to break such barriers easily says Velusamy His observation of the elephants routine was more interesting Elephants cross this stretch anywhere between 7 pm and 9 pm and retrace their way back into the forest between 3 am and 5 am If they cross the electric fence and enter the farm there s no way one can save the crop They will attack and destroy tens of hundreds of plants within minutes They usually invade the field only when the plant is fivesix months old or is nearing the flowering stage The sound of drums crackers and the sight of fire keep them off the field Interestingly elephants follow the same path When asked how he manages has engaged two security guards We do not get agriculture labourers here and the cost of engaging security guards is even more expensive I pay Rs 500day for keeping a watch on elephants and such guards are difficult to come by these days adds Velu Labour shortage Nagaraj who lives about 2 km away from the foothills at Jallimedu cultivates vegetables It s not easy There is a huge shortage of agriculture labour in this part and we have to protect our farmlands from animal intrusion as well Many of them have given their land on lease or sold and moved out said this farmer Intrusion of monkeys is very high here says Srinivasan a farmer in Kalar These farmers and a few others feel that this product should help them keep the wild animals at bay It is not poisonous The strong odour keeps them off For now this seems a best remedy After years of struggle says Srinivasan Flying pizza Soon a drone might deliver your Domino s order Washington Flying pizza Do nt be surprised if next

really noticing While her name might not be a household standard scenestealing roles in Whale Rider and Boy and a regular seat on Maori Television s panel show Ask Your Aunties have certainly made Rachel House memorable The shouty woman riding the red rideon mower in that Sky Television ad That s her too On the day we were meant to meet House needs to be in Australia A couple of nice Aussie boys have invited her over to Sydney to audition for a topsecret television pilot It turns out those lads are the Bondi Hipsters the duo behind the Beached Az cartoon that gently mocked us Kiwis in front of an online audience of seven million They can name her and they want her too It s not an invitation she gets every day then No No voice Oh hi do you want to fly to Sydney in the next 24 hours please and be in our thing No definitely not I get really great jobs just not involving travel Shit no After more than 20 years in the industry House still finds it hard to believe she is wanted in front of the camera She reckons she is an unusuallooking woman and there s not a lot of room for those these days It still surprises me when I get cast in something I m not your you know I m I remember thinking really early on that you have to look a particular way and I m quite aware of my look so I always thought I would nt get a lot of screen work But of course when I m directing I never take those things into consideration It s just like who s good who s going to bring it We are hard on ourselves Like many of the characters she s played House is nt the flashy type A Ponsonby local she picks a really quiet unpretentious cafe for a coffee and a chat a day earlier than planned It s tucked away from the Ladies That Lunch and their miniature dogs who could nt be further from the way she goes about things In the flesh the 41yearold is captivating and instantly familiar Wrapped up in a black puffer jacket with her mane of dark curls tucked away she has a face you recognise quickly despite the pair of sunglasses hugging it tightly She also uses the word totes a lot probably jokingly possibly not In her latest film set for release on the 27th of this month House is front and centre there is no background here White Lies is a confronting production based on Witi Ihimaera s novella Medicine Woman written and directed by Mexican filmmaker Dana Rotberg House plays Maraea the servant of Rebecca Antonia Prebble a wealthy woman who needs the help of medicine woman Paraiti Whirimako Black to hide a secret that will destroy her life in European settler society Originally House auditioned for the role of Paraiti but director Rotberg was adamant that part would be played by a fluent te reo speaker from the Tuhoe tribe House was neither and she turned down the chance to play Maraea when she was first offered it Rotberg managed to talk her round It s not like I read the script and went Who s the lead I want that role I never do that because it s not the kind of actor I am And I m happy with that happy with little walkon roles staunch aunties with hearts of gold she says Without spoiling the film s twist in House s words it s like The Sixth Sense the role of Maraea can get This was a step into the unknown Actors wrestle with it all the time they want to be liked she says They do They want to play something that people are going to like And again that s not something that s ever made my mind up but in this case Maraea s pretty bad She s extreme The themes of race and identity in White Lies are not completely foreign to House Adopted by Scottish parents John and Sheila she was raised in Kamo Whangarei While she always felt Maori she says it took her a while to really connect with the culture I ve never not felt Maori ever And because of the era I grew up in I was never not seen as that I would walk down the street with Mum and Dad and people would say Look there s a little Maori girl My parents were quite keen to Maori at university before she adopted me and Dad s just a good old socialist you know A leftie I ve been trying to make my way towards the culture since high school but my perceptions of what being Maori meant were quite different to I think what they are It was her parents who steered her towards ballet piano and speech and drama lessons from the age of five to help her gain confidence As she says she did nt catch the acting bug she was shoved into its path With other kids there were performances on local verandas in front of proud parents before House moved on to the Northland Youth Theatre From there Toi Whakaari New Zealand Drama School seemed like an obvious route But I did nt really take the craft of it seriously fora while It took me a while to really get it she says When she got involved in casting Maori theatre with its strong was always interested in the stories we were telling it just needed to be bigger it needed to be a bigger concept for me to take it seriously I think When the outcome actually meant something and it was nt just mememe Then you understand what you are doing you are a storyteller you can bring people together and you can educate It allows us to put ourselves in other people s shoes and have a different outlook on the world It s powerful In her own story there are only a few things she would change She wishes she had gone to university as well as drama school Gone and studied things that are interesting political science religious studies maybe women s studies Things to broaden her horizons I think it s important just studying acting is really stupid You ve got to get a sense of the world like anything Be a better human read more House is more comfortable steering the ship from the director s chair In the past year alone she has worked on Hui an urban Maori play that premiered at the Auckland Arts Festival and was artistic director of the te reo Maori version of Shakespeare s Troilus and Cressida which appeared at London s Globe Theatre in 2012 Last year was topped off when House received an Arts Foundation Laureate Award an honour that recognised her whole career from the groundbreaking directorial work to those roles audiences did nt immediately associate with her I could not believe it You reach a certain age and everybody wants you to be on a panel and I thought that s why they were calling When they told me I was very accusatory I told them to shut up and I swore a lot And cried a lot too I blubbered like a baby After appearing in films like Boy and Eagle Vs Shark House is used to laughing a laugh but this year is set to be a bit different along with White Lies House will also appear in Hope and Wire the miniseries based around the Christchurch earthquakes These days she lives and breathes her work a lot more than she used to I do nt want to do things by halves I really love the work that I do and I feel like you have to go that extra mile to do it because it is a responsibility Telling stories is a responsibility There are certainly times I have had to do things halfassed but in the past few years it has nt been an option If you are going to do it do it well The ultimate aim is directing a featurelength film In 2008 she attended the Prague Film School where the constant need to churn out stories and scripts meant she could work without secondguessing herself Back home those doubting thoughts are harder to ignore When I was work so there was no room for voices of doubt Just do it by the end of the week and you do That was really liberating having that pressure Maybe it was shit but you just did the best you could with it Now when there is nt that pressure I ll just sit Writing I find hard because it s so personal and there are so many voices of doubt It s probably because I ve read so many scripts over the years and now I m in a position where I m asked to critique so you re already critiquing your work before you ve even started The number of times I ve thought Oh I m going to write this story Why No one s going to want to hear that it s dumb What a silly story So I just have to harden up She s equally as selfdeprecating when it comes to her chances at the strong sense that for House flash and cash will always come second to a good yarn I just do nt think I d be very good at it You have to be very technically brainy and I m not technically brainy unfortunately Wow would nt it be amazing to play with all that money but I d be wasting a lot of people s time If it was a Hollywood blockbuster with a really good story sure But it has to have a good story OPINION Until recently in New Zealand it s been usual to insure your home on the basis of total replacement cover This meant that you would provide information to your insurance company about the size of your home and if it was destroyed then your insurer would arrange to demolish the damaged structure and rebuild you a new dwelling to the same size and specification as it was before There was no limit on the amount your insurer was required to spend in order to replace your home Since the Christchurch earthquakes many New Zealand insurers have changed the basis of their home insurance policies they now require you to specify a sum insured for your home This means that if your home is damaged or destroyed then the sum insured is the maximum amount the insurer will be prepared to spend to remedy the damage The onus is now on you to tell your insurer the cost to rebuild your house If you underestimate the cost and your house is your home to the same size and specification as it was before It s also worth noting that the rateable value of your home does nt have a direct bearing on the cost to rebuild therefore it is not a good idea to rely on the RV for insurance purposes Instead you should investigate the actual cost of rebuilding your home to set your sum insured There are two methods to help you set the sum insured 1 Online calculators Some insurance companies provide online calculators to help you work out the likely cost of rebuilding your home If you choose this option you may want to ensure you cover any recent house additions or renovations If you re contemplating any major renovations within the next 12 months make sure these are covered as they re likely to increase the cost to rebuild your home to its current standard 2 Property valuer An alternative to using an online calculator particularly if your home is an older house with period features or perhaps a specialist property valuer A valuer can provide you with a more accurate valuation of rebuild costs than an online calculator so you can use that information to establish the sum insured When renewing your home insurance policy you should also remember that you have a duty to disclose all material facts to the insurer which may affect the risk being insured For example if you are planning substantial renovations at your property or perhaps anticipate leaving the property vacant for a period while you are overseas on holiday then you should disclose that information to your insurer If you forget to provide that information it may mean you could jeopardise your insurance cover if you make a claim on your policy The need for you to set a sum insured when you renew your home insurance policy is a good reminder to review all the information you have provided to your insurer about your home such as your excess and also a review of your household contents insurance It s important to get your sum goes wrong Using an online calculator or a professional valuer will help you get the most from your policy Elspeth Horner is a partner in

soon wonder how we lived without this fundamental part of network infrastructure Having played with it I think Microsoft is very close to being right but there are some bugs to work out and misconceptions to dispel Internet Protocol version 6 IPv6 promises rainbows and kittens because every device with an IPv6 address can communicate directly with any other That is a happy world for application developers Many who preach the gospel of endtoend connectivity have assured me that the world will collapse unless we drastically lower the knowledge required to develop an internetconnected application Direct answer But network and systems administrators are somewhat less keen on having their network attack surface transformed from a single externally addressable system into every system plugged into the network For reasons of you do not pay me enough for this administrators prefer defending one device instead of thousands Sadly application developers won the war of securing the future rests on network administrators And that is why DirectAccess was created In its original incarnation DirectAccess mediated communication between a client s public IPv6 and a company s IPv6enabled server fleet DirectAccess verified that the computer attempting access was domainjoined patched authorised for access and so forth It provided a single point of defence even in an IPv6 world In a future where the right of anyone with a computer to directly address every device on your network from your internetconnected light bulb to a hospital s medical equipment is enshrined in nerd law DirectAccess gives Microsoftusing administrators a fighting chance If you can master DirectAccess then you can take advantage of the benefits endtoend connectivity can offer while mitigating the risks Most of the confusion surrounding DirectAccess stems from the fact that it is no more a single technology than Microsoft Exchange is What we think of as Exchange is a large collection of highly interdependent applications These in turn are dependent upon applications that we Information Services IIS and certificate management Firewall extension DirectAccess is no different The second misconception we need to deal with is that despite layers of confusing marketing DirectAccess access is not a virtual private network VPN VPNlike technologies are almost always involved in a DirectAccess configuration but they are to DirectAccess as IIS is to Exchange or DNS to Active Directory DirectAccess is a first attempt at making an IPv6 firewall that mere mortals can supposedly comprehend In essence the core executable is a connection broker You connect to it it verifies you are who you say you are and then lets you access company resources Indeed DirectAccess will not work if you disable Windows Firewall If you think of DirectAccess as an extension of Windows Firewall rather than a VPN technology the rest of this overview will make a lot more sense In the real world almost no one has IPv6 for all internal servers for all the that you might want to have a client connect to your network It will be decades before this becomes a reality This means that any practical DirectAccess deployment relies upon some other technologies At a minimum it uses Isatap to ensure IPv6 connectivity between all intranet sites and connected clients DirectAccess also uses the NAT64 and DNS64 protocol translators to ensure that clients can access IPv4 systems on your network The Server 2008 R2 version did not include these elements as part of the core offering Server 2012 does In addition to being made up of several sub technologies DirectAccess has been merged into the larger Remote Access role within Server 2012 It is no longer seen as a novel technology and has become merely one more subcomponent of RemoteAccess The actress 55 said Joanie s a character I ve never played before my first grandma Dear lord that came round quick Shares Get soaps news by email

and other assets Back in the 1970s when governments printed money it tended to be retail prices that were inflated Today it is asset prices that go up Stop printing money and those asset prices are likely to come down But that is not the only hangover from the QE splurge that we are likely to see Faced with a serious economic crisis in 200708 Western governments encouraged by lots of expert economists decided that the Easy money and credit they believed would boost economic output and allow recovery The trouble is that all that cheap money and credit has had a distortive effect and not just on the value of the FTSE 100 or the price of luxury flats in central London Cheap money and credit has meant enormous levels of what economists call malinvestment Like cholesterol malinvestment clogs up the economic arteries We are often told that in the first decade of this century the UK economy experienced a spectacular boombust cycle Perhaps the reality is that we had the boom part but that the government s aggressive monetary intervention after 200708 means that we never really had the bust bit Boombust turned out to be more boomno bust cycle As QE comes to an end the key question is not whether the stock market comes down but rather how much malinvestment is there still in the system Have we really managed to avoid the bust bit in the boombust cycle or merely Share Efforts to curb the availability of child abuse images online should not be limited to the searchable web as criminals are increasingly turning to P2P networks and the dark web to distribute content This week has seen a series of ISPs and web firms talk up the work they are doing to clamp down on the proliferation of child abuse images on the net Google announced plans to invest millions of pounds in this area while Talk Talk BT Sky and Virgin Media committed to collectively invest 1 million over the next four years in tackling the problem The bulk of their activities seem to be centred on the eradication tracking and blocking of child abuse images on the searchable web However concerns have been raised that not enough is being done to clampdown on similar content being shared via P2P and anonymised web networks Speaking to IT Pro Christian Berg chief executive of NetClean said criminals are likely to use these alternative networks more on the searchable web You can not solve this problem simply by blocking http traffic It is an important piece of the puzzle but there are so many ways of sharing this material and http addresses are not the preferred method of distribution he explained There s definitely not enough being done to tackle these hidden networks and I know there is a will by law enforcers to do more but resources are tight He also said it is easy to tell search engines social networks and the ISP community they need to do more but the issue is not quite as straight forward as that People look at Google and the ISPs and say this is a problem of the internet and you re a bit part of the internet you have to fix it he explained Obviously the internet is being used to spread it but child abuse is really not an internet problem It s a human one how to approach the issue have centred on URL blocking but Berg questioned how effective a tool this is It is usually employed to protect UK citizens from accidentally stumbling on illegal content rather than track down criminals he said If you are into this material you do nt have to be very tech savvy to know how to circumnavigate it he added His company develops technologies and software that blocks and tracks the online spread of child abuse content which is used by law enforcement agencies and enterprises We sell our software to organisations that can scan their servers their laptops and desktops for known child abuse images and videos he explained We re not talking about URLs but actual files which means we can find things on USB sticks too and We then tell the organisation they need

arrears over an extended period I was preparing the postdated cheques when the CRA called a day later saying it could nt agree to the deal The client would have only half the time we agreed on he recalls When I asked why we could nt keep the longer payment period I was told It s our policy I asked to be sent the policy The supervisor said there was no policy available He said he would complain on his client s behalf and got a shocking reply A CRA employee told me If you make a complaint I m going to enforce says Weisman who works in the tax law group at Torkin Manes LLP in Toronto In another case about interpreting a clause in the Income Tax Act he wrote to the CRA citing legal arguments and precedents The response was We disagree I asked for more information so I could explain to the client what the CRA s position was I got the same response Weisman met with me and Taxpayers Ombudsman Paul Dub last week to talk about the need to strengthen the taxpayer bill of rights Earlier that day National Revenue Minister Gail Shea had announced measures to ensure that taxpayers could complain and request a review without fear of CRA reprisal People should feel free to speak up We wo nt tolerate any abuse of authority by employees she told reporters at a CRA office in Scarborough While there was no direct evidence of misconduct Shea said she takes such allegations seriously The to employees found to be threatening taxpayers Dub a lawyer named as the first taxpayers ombudsman in 2008 called it a significant step forward for those who had reservations about complaining about poor service In five years on the job he s talked to a wide crosssection of taxpayers and to recipients of government benefits tied into their tax returns He s heard many people express concern about consequences arising from a complaint to the CRA saying they were reluctant to exercise their rights That s why he asked for a 16th right to be added to the taxpayer bill of rights hoping to increase confidence that the system would be administered fairly Not only has the Minister heard and accepted my recommendation he told the news conference but the CRA is committed to implementing it Complaints about employee misconduct would go to a person s supervisor Dub told me This was unacceptable given a common perception that bosses complaints about misconduct will be investigated by a separate office within the CRA similar to the internal affairs department of the police The taxpayer bill of rights has no legal force and does not cover tax policy It talks about rights to privacy and confidentiality timely information and relief from penalties and interest because of extraordinary circumstances Under the 11th right the CRA says it will be accountable for what it does When we make a decision about your tax or benefit affairs we will explain that decision and tell you about your rights and obligations There s a tollfree number to call the Office of the Taxpayers Ombudsman 18665863839 Those outside Canada and the United States can call 6139462310 Please note that we accept collect calls says the website It is the law that was supposed to free the grapes ending a prohibitionera federal ban on individual purchases of wine across provincial borders It has nt quite worked out that way A year after the passage of Bill C311 the vast majority of Canadians still ca nt buy wine directly from an outofprovince winery unless they haul it back themselves That s because just two provinces British Columbia and Manitoba have so far authorized interprovincial Internet and phone sales to individuals since the law was passed Most notably Ontario Alberta and Quebec continue to jealously guard the revenues that flow through their own liquor distribution systems the latest example of internal trade barriers that persist in spite of concerted efforts to remove them It just seems so ludicrous to me that we make a homegrown product It s local It s Canadian It supports farming It s small business lamented Sandra Oldfield chief executive and wine maker at Tinhorn Creek kinds of things we should be supporting in Canada The small winery located at the southern end of the Okanagan Valley near Osoyoos BC still ca nt sell its wine online or by phone to Canadians who want its product except in Manitoba and BC I do nt think the intent or the spirit of C311 has been followed by the provinces so that s frustrating for me Ms Oldfield said Other wineries are choosing to turn a blind eye to lingering provincial restrictions taking their cue instead from the federal government I sell directly to consumers in Ontario right now and I m not apologizing for it said John Skinner proprietor of Painted Rock Estate Winery of Penticton BC Mr Skinner said his growing direct sales in Ontario represent a tiny slice of the massive wine market but are nonetheless crucial to making his small business viable Speaking at an event at another BC winery last week federal Industry Minister by Ontario Alberta and other provinces The elephants in the room are Ontario and Alberta agreed Beth McMahon vicepresident of government and public affairs for the Canadian Vintners Association the lobby group for Canadian wineries They see it as a threat to their liquor retail systems They do nt want to see people go online or join a wine club and get wine shipped to them and step around their own marketing systems Industry sources said the provinces also worry that allowing Internet sales could open a back door for the sale of foreign wines directly to consumers But the amendment did nt touch the provinces right to to regulate the possession movement and sale of wine The Canada Revenue Agency points out on its website that supporting provincial legislative or regulatory changes are also required to permit individuals to move wine interprovincially or to place orders with wineries by telephone or over the Internet The Liquor Control Board of Ontario which has a monopoly direct is unnecessary because consumers can buy any wine not sold in its stores through the LCBO s private ordering program But wineries say that s not viable because of steep markups charged by the LCBO Mr Skinner of Painted Rock said he would have to sell his wine for nearly 100 a bottle compared to his normal 55 list price So while the LCBO may say any Canadian wine is available the reality is that most small wineries ca nt make money and so do nt sell that way Mr Skinner said Another anomaly is that Ontario allows its own residents to buy directly from Ontario wineries but yet balks at interprovincial sales It really is absurd said Ms McMahon of the Canadian Vintners Association The provinces fear of Internet sales is misguided she added The US experience where 40 states now permit it has shown that it expands the overall market but grabs just 1 per cent of total sales Ms Canadian wine culture not doing an end run around provincial liquor boards With wine it s all about the connections you make with people she said It s really hard to do if you ca nt ship to them Restrictions All rights reserved Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content

40000 murders Add to It was one of the world s most patient and tenacious campaigns for justice After more than 22 years it finally ended on Sunday at a luxurious seaside villa in Senegal when the former dictator of Chad was arrested on allegations of overseeing the murder of up to 40000 people Hiss ne Habr accused of systematic torture and political killings in his eightyear rule over the impoverished African nation had been living freely in exile in a mansion in Senegal since his overthrow in 1990 Efforts by his victims to prosecute him were stalled endlessly by legal technicalities and political obstruction and he became a symbol of how African rulers enjoyed impunity from justice Mr Habr now 70 was arrested at his villa in Dakar the capital of Senegal Reports said he was taken into custody by paramilitary police Senegalese officials confirmed he had been arrested and photos showed him being led Mr Habr had been protected by the government of former Senegal president Abdoulaye Wade who stalled every attempt at a domestic or international prosecution But last year Mr Wade was defeated in an election and the new president Macky Sall pledged to take action against corrupt officials who had been shielded by the previous government He agreed last year to set up a special court in the Senegal justice system to prosecute Mr Habr and the court was established in February The trial of Mr Habr is expected to begin late next year or in early 2015 After 22 years Habr s victims can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel said Reed Brody a lawyer at Human Rights Watch who has been helping former political prisoners and other victims since 1999 Twelve years ago Mr Brody stumbled on a vast pile of documents at the abandoned headquarters of Mr Habr s dreaded political police The documents listed 12321 victims of abuse jail A commission of inquiry in Chad has estimated that Mr Habr s government was responsible for about 40000 politically motivated murders and about 200000 cases of torture Despite the atrocities Mr Habr was supported by the United States and France throughout his rule Washington had provided covert CIA paramilitary support to help him take power in a coup in 1982 and it continued to give him tens of millions of dollars in military aid during his rule After he fled to Senegal he used millions of dollars allegedly stolen from Chad to build a network of supporters in Senegal allowing him to evade justice Mr Brody said Former political prisoners from Chad have been pursuing justice against Mr Habr We are finally going to be able to confront our tormentor and regain our dignity as human beings said a statement on Sunday by Cl ment Abaifouta president of the Association of Victims of the Crimes of Hiss ne Habr s

GATHANYCENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROLREUTERS Mosquitoes bugging you University of Manitoba students created an app for that Add to It does nt ward off the annoying bloodthirsty critters with a wave of a smartphone but it does allow users to warn others and provide information to figure out which infested neighbourhoods to avoid The app developed by a team at the University of Manitoba lets users rate mosquito activity in an area information that is then uploaded to a map which all users can see video Engineering student Rory Jacob says he and his colleagues came up with the idea after using similar technology Being from Manitoba where mosquitoes are considered the province s unofficial bird Jacob says it did nt take long for them to figure out how to apply the technology to the bloodsuckers People can check the app called the M Tracker before they leave the house so they know whether to douse themselves in bug spray he says If you re going to an area of the city to a park or something with your family and you do nt know if you re going to bring mosquito spray you can take a look at the app says Jacob who worked on the app with engineering professor Bob McLeod and fellow student Chen Liu The City of Winnipeg diligently tracks mosquito numbers using scientific traps but the app could give officials another more personal perspective Jacob suggests And while mosquitoes are plentiful in Western Canada the app can be used anywhere in the world It s been downloaded in Russia in map builtin to essentially tell you how the mosquitoes are in your area The app has been downloaded about 200 times Jacob hopes it will take off as more people hear about it Realistically the more people you get the better the data is going to be You ll be able to get more consistent results out of it Couple s love nest on the Bow one of first Calgary houses to be demolished Add to From the front of the house it still looks like the charming postwar abode it once was The gravel driveway is neat the paint is fresh and only the yellow tape blocking access to the yard gives away the fact that this house has more serious damage than its neighbours It takes a walk to the side yard to see the precarious sixmetre hole below this Bowness neighbourhood house Video video When Bow River flood waters rushed in on the night of June 20 part of the old brick foundation of the house washed away and water flowed directly into the basement Now what used to be a downstairs studio space and bathroom looks like a muddy cave filed with an assortment of tossed household items including a wrappingpaper roll a binder and a bookshelf Eleven days after floods hit Calgary continues a cleanup and rebuilding effort collectively will cost billions Amid the state of emergency city safety officers have been scouring the worsthit neighbourhoods around the clock to pinpoint dangerous homes like this where the structure is fragile and the inhabitants will never be allowed to return The house is coming down said Scott Miller a city safety codes officer who has been working every day to assess damage in homes since the floods hit Mr Miller was the one to tell Geoff Wilcox and his wife Sharon Raycroft that their white 1947 house nestled on the banks of the Bow River which more resembles an Ontario lakefront cottage than a city home will be one of the first of many Calgary buildings that city safety inspectors order demolished as a result of the floods I ve lived in Calgary all my life and this is all so strange Mr Miller said The number of homes that will be written off is still unknown But Calgary s Emergency Management Agency says as many as significant period of time and the city believes at least 2400 houses are damaged Sharon had it fixed up like a little jewel box Mr Wilcox 55 a geologist said of his house It was our love nest on the Bow While some of the homes around them have been deemed structurally sound the house they ve lived in for the past 21 years will be torn down within the week The water reached as high as 30 centimetres on the 800squarefoot main floor where the floor is now so warped the front door wo nt open The couple managed to salvage the pale apricot dress Ms Raycroft s mother wore on her wedding day in the 1920s and her parents old oak piano but lost their photo albums Now they are deciding whether to rebuild and where to land Calgary is a beautiful city and the people are great Mr Wilcox said But it s an expensive time Already it s hard to get drywall in this city Many Calgarians are being forced to make the same kind of big choices Just across the Bow River from Mr Wilcox and Ms Raycroft s property the land behind a church and several homes had sunk or eroded away to the point where one house no longer has a yard just a deck perched above the embankment The Calgary Real Estate Board said house listings will fall and house sales in floodaffected neigbourhoods will face price discounts in the short term But over all the board s president Becky Walters said the city s resale market is strong enough to weather the terrible event Other Alberta communities were hard hit as well most notably High River the 13000person town south of Calgary which saw the worst of Alberta s flood damage While the Alberta government has pledged as much as 10000 per household in immediate help for homeowners affected by the flood a broader more expensive for the damages or the loss of an entire house especially one in many of the wealthy Calgary neighbourhoods such as Roxboro Rideau Park and Elbow Park that were some of the most badly flooded neighbourhoods will be a difficult question Even Mayor Naheed Nenshi has noted the province faces a quandary how to structure an aid program that could end up helping the richest people in the city in the wake of the disaster Some of the homes in the city are very expensive homes but not all of them Mr Nenshi said last week There s a wide variety of people who have been impacted at every part of the socioeconomic scale And this will be interesting for the province frankly if I can be a pundit for just a second as they re developing their disaster relief plans they re going to have to think hard about that question Crocodile attacks Cancun visitor A crocodile bit two fingers off an American tourist s hand after the man apparently pretended to give food to the predator on a

By Michelle Singerman Published Wednesday Jul 10 2013 0101 PM Novelist Kevin Kwan s new book Crazy Rich Asians is a runaway hit China is booming The wealth being created is otherworldly and so is the lifestyle of the country s superrich But the gossiping scheming and backbiting has been kept under wraps until now with the release of Kevin Kwan s new satirical novel Crazy Rich Asians set to become the most talked about book of the summer What a trip That s how Kevin Kwan who will be back in Toronto this fall explains the extravagant lives of particular Chinese families His flashy fictional tale is a story inspired by his own life having been born in Singapore and raised in the US It s how do you describe these its subjects Are they very rich are they filthy rich or are they crazy rich In many ways crazy is the most appropriate word The book focuses on the exorbitant wealth that exists among Chinese family dynasties But just like every family these billionaires are not exempt from the jealousy envy and pressures that eat away at relationships I thought it would be interesting to showcase this world as it clashes with the new mainland Chinese money and all the various things that are happening at this time because Asia s really going through a new gilded age he says Writing this book offered relief for the firsttime author who conceived the idea while spending time with his sick father During that period Kwan s dad told him stories of his own childhood and reminisced with his son This was my escape to be able to write something comedic and fun he says Creating a story that focuses not just lives affected by this great wealth is unique for the typical book available on Chinese culture There s this Americanborn Chinese girl who travels around the world back to her boyfriend to Singapore he explains Being AsianAmerican she thinks she knows how Asians are and how Chinese people are And she discovers this world of very intricate complex personalities and roles and traditions that she just had no clue as an American existed Kwan tells of how his editor actually made him tone down some of the descriptions of the people homes and fleets of cars and private jets because the truth was just too unbelievable The explosion of wealth in Asia has piqued people s interest in the Eastern continent he says hoping that in addition to a fun summer read he offers insight and education These people live halfway around the world they have these mysterious families and yet they have the same issues of jealousy of snobbery of money lot better he says It really speaks to the universality of all of us The battle over street hockey is not over but city officials have called for a brief intermission Nearly 20 residents in the Cricket Club area recently challenged the

contestants in a Canada Day cake baking contest gets its just desserts in the upcoming Seaway Valley Theatre Company production of the deliciously decadent comedy Cake Walk by Colleen Curran It s a very funny story of all these different women with different personalities and different agendas all vying for the top prize of a trip to France explained director Lacie Petrynka There s even a little romantic twist in the mix As far as what the audience can expect Petrynka said that although it s not a farce per se there is some slapstick and plenty oneliners The characters themselves and their delivery are funny It s very good writing As far as the plot the director could nt and would nt in a small town in Ontario with period music costumes and attitude another great part of the fun of the show is all these beautiful cakes that the audience gets to see she adds including an elaborate wedding cake The seven person cast includes a lot of new faces to the company It s a nice mix between veteran actor and new actors and they all meshed so well together It s so nice to have new talent come out A frequent performer with the company this is Petrynka s second foray in the director s chair the last being Steel Magnolias a couple of years ago She says that she loves the job and feels her acting experience has helped her out You get to learn what to watch for when directing It s definitely a challenging job but I appreciate a challenge Cake Walk runs July 18 19 20 25 26 27 evening performances beginning at 730 with 21 a Dream Builder Studio 2107 Second Street Tickets are 20

artifacts Even the footprints the Apollo 11 astronauts left on the moon would be protected under a proposed bill to create a national historic park on the lunar surface ByEmily WilkinsThe Dallas Morning News Published on Wed Jul 10 2013 DALLAS It might not get as many visitors as Yellowstone National Park but Rep Eddie Bernice Johnson a Democrat from Texas wants a national historic park on the moon The word park can be misleading the legislation she proposed would protect artifacts left on the moon from Apollo missions 11 through 17 No ground on the moon would be included although the bill requires the nomination of Neil Armstrong s first footprints on the moon for a UNESCO World Heritage Site which offers protection to threatened sites In light of other nations and private entities developing the ability to go to the Moon the United States must be proactive in protecting artifacts left in a written statement The bill which was introduced in the House on Monday is sponsored by Johnson the ranking Democrat of the House Committee on Science Space and Technology and fellow committee member Rep Donna Edwards a Democrat from Maryland A spokeswoman for the Democrats on the committee said those who take or damage artifacts on the moon would be subject to punishment under the same laws as those who take or damage property in national parks Obviously such a bill would be hard to enforce and hard to protect Johnson admits it sounds farfetched to have a national historical park on the moon but believes legal protection for the objects there is important I do nt think that there is anything farfetched about protecting and preserving such irreplaceable items and such a hallowed place she said in a statement The committee spokesperson also said the head of the Russian space agency Vladimir Popovkin has called for protection of relics from the first manned missions to both the House Science Space and Technology Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee The warrants were executed at residences on Porteous Avenue Hudson s Bay Road and on Rosegrove Road in the Kirkland Lake area and resulted in the seizure of over 24000 in illicit narcotics and four firearms These police actions form part of a larger parallel international investigation centering on various forms of drug trafficking including but not limited to online distribution of drugs and synthetic forms of contraband substances The investigation is still underway and involves a number of police forces and drug enforcement agencies some located beyond Canadian borders The exhibits seized include large quantities of marijuana cannabis resin hash oil morphine other synthetic drugs various drug paraphernalia and four firearms The controlled substances seized have a street

Bangladesh smiles during an interview at UBC where she will begin law school in September Rumana Monzur made headlines after she was viciously attacked and blinded by her husband during a trip home to Bangladesh in 2011 But Monzur who is now preparing for law school says she does nt want to be seen as a victim VANCOUVER Rumana Monzur can picture a towering mountain or the blue sky on a sunny day She remembers what the ocean looks like and can still conjure an image of water stretching out to the horizon But she has nt seen her trip home to visit her family in Bangladesh she was the victim of a vicious domestic assault that left her blind and her husband charged with attempted murder Each moment I miss seeing her my daughter and not only her I miss seeing people Monzur 35 said Wednesday Monzur has spent the past two years on a remarkable recovery that saw her finish a master s degree at the University of British Columbia where she now lives with her sixyearold daughter and her parents She is now preparing to attend law school Monzur was attacked in June 2011 during a trip home to Dhaka Bangladesh A year earlier she left her daughter her husband and her parents behind in Dhaka to study political science in Vancouver The attack was widely reported in local media in Bangladesh and the details of what happened including photos of her badly injured face taken in her hospital room quickly filtered back to her friends and colleagues in nearly 100000 to cover Monzur s medical and living costs once she returned to BC and the case fuelled a debate about violence against women in her native Bangladesh Two years later Monzur has learned to read Braille and uses adaptive technology to read and write She uses a cane to navigate when she walks and she no longer covers her eyes with shaded glasses The scars on her face have faded She successfully presented her master s thesis which examined the impact of climate change and rising ocean levels in Bangladesh this past spring and she was recently accepted to a number of law schools She decided to stay at UBC and will enter the school s law program this fall Monzur said she tries not to think about the attack that robbed her of her vision which she refers to only as the incident Dwelling on what happened only leads to questions without any answers If I think about it it just leads me nowhere role in that conversation and she hopes other women and girls including her own daughter can learn from the horrors she experienced at the hands of her spouse First of all I do nt want people to see me as a victim I want people to see me as a survivor said Monzur who added that violence against women must be brought out into the open Monzur s former husband Hasan Sayeed Sumon was arrested and charged with attempted murder soon after the attack but he died under mysterious circumstances in December 2011 Hundreds of puffins and pufflings getting ready to leave Scotland Hundreds of puffins and their newborn pufflings are getting ready to leave Scotland as the breeding season comes to and end The colourful birds have been nesting on islands in the Forth off North Berwick East Lothian for the past few months The population has managed to successfully breed despite severe weather conditions which saw around 3500 of the birds die It also delayed the breeding season by around three weeks Now they are preparing to return to the Atlantic Ocean and anyone keen to see them before they leave has until the end of July Tom Brock from the Scottish Seabird Centre said We were concerned about the large number of puffin fatalities right up the east coast just before the start of the breeding season this year which was probably due to late spring storms and malnourished birds However I am pleased to say that all indications are that this year s breeding season has them carrying sand eels always a sure sign that they have chicks to feed and for the last few weeks visitors have able to spot the birds nesting with their chicks on Isle of May and Craigleith The fact that the breeding season started late does nt mean we can expect the birds to remain in the area for longer than normal however and the last week in July will probably the last chance to see them this year until they return to breed again next May We need to know where you are to make sure you get the right programmes Please

Bangor Netball Dome due to be completed by September is a joint project with Bangor University working closely with Sport Wales and Welsh Netball They believe an average of 2000 women and girls from the area will be regularly using the facility which will have two undercover courts by September 2016 The project will be coordinated by a Welsh Netball Development Officer based at Bangor University The Dome will provide both recreational Back to Netball and adult leisure classes as well as providing the opportunity to spot and support gifted young players It is forecast that the Dome will allow the creation the development of new coaches from the area and secure competitive opportunities for both junior and senior players A total of 80000 of Calls of Action funding has been awarded to Bangor University to support the construction of the new purpose built facility which includes two permanent undercover courts with appropriate heating and lighting to ensure year round play Funding has also been allocated to Disability Sport Wales and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to provide a new service that will help those with an impairment to get more exercise It will help them find finding and access suitable clubs or activities to help maintain fitness levels Funding has currently been agreed for three years and it is anticipated that more than 1000 people per year will become regular participants in some form of physical activity or sport Becoming fully selfsustainable after the three year funding period it is hoped that the programme will then be rolled out across other Welsh Health Trusts As a further benefit the partnership will also be aiming to identify and journey to compete at an elite international level Adele Baumgardt Sport Wales Board Member said Community sport is at the heart of an active and healthy nation We are proud of the developments that have been made in this area across Wales especially postOlympic and Paralympic games The challenge however in ensuring that we continue to develop creating a lasting legacy in community sport is in overcoming some long term and untouched barriers that will allow us to turn hundreds of participants into thousands reaching out to groups not currently participating and making the reality of having every child hooked on sport for life more achievable Alongside the multiple long term health benefits the programme will aim to deliver through increased activity levels it is also anticipated that many of the projects will also offer the creation of jobs and increased tourism opportunities Tom Overton Sport Wales Manager added We accept that there are currently obstacles which prevent specific groups from participating in community sport and access shortfalls Calls for Action will address these barriers targeting underrepresented groups improving access to facilities and providing individuals with opportunities to develop the right skills to be physically active We have extremely ambitious plans in progressing community sport in terms of the numbers of participants that we want to see and also in the inclusion of specific groups who are not currently participating The plans and forecasted outcomes of these projects look set to deliver a dramatic shift change against these ambitions Advertising Send a story Advertise with the Daily Post Print The Daily Post is North Wales

awkward job of transporting a canoe could soon be a thing of the past after an inventor has designed one that can be packed down to the size of a suitcase Called a Stakanoo the boat is made of three sections that slot together in less than a minute to create the 76ft vessel These sections can then be separated and packed inside each other to make the 19kg boat fully portable so that it fits in the boot of a car with one seat folded down on the backseats or stored in a cupboard at home A keen canoeist and inventor from Somerset has designed a portable kayak The Stakanoo pictured is made of three sections that slot together and can be stacked together to fit into the back of a car or stored in a cupboard When packed away the Stakanoo can fit comfortably into a car boot pictured left as well as sit across the backseat right The boat only weighs 19kg which means it can 60 seconds without the need for any specialist tools THE 800 FOLDABLE ORIGAMI BOAT Last year two design students from London created a foldable boat based on the ones created using origami The fullsize vessel is folded from a 8ft by 5ft piece of plastic and can be transformed from a flat sheet to a rowing boat by a single person in two minutes using only three components Another model of the 800 Foldboat can be folded up and carried in a backpack The single sheet of plastic can be folded over and over again up to 6000 times and comes in two designs one that folds into an easytocarry parcel and one that unfolds completely flat The Stakanoo is the brain child of keen canoeist and inventor Stuart Woodward from Bath Somerset Woodward designed the vessel as a solution to motorists stacking canoes and kayaks onto the roof of their cars He wanted to design a canoe that could be packed into the boot of a car to negate the need fuel efficiency because there is less drag created as the car drives on a motorway The Stakanoo is made up of three slottable compartments the tip of the bow connects to a section containing the seat and the midship which then slots into the stern These sections have been designed in such a way so that they fit inside one another Woodward claims it only takes 60 seconds to assemble the Stakanoo and less time to fold it down RELATED ARTICLES Share this article And because the sections slot together this can be done singlehandedly without any tools When the three sections are fitted together the full length of the Stakanoo is 76ft long and 225ft wide This series of images shows how the three slottable sections of the Stakanoo fit together to form the 19kg portable boat pictured top These sections can then be unpacked and fitted together to form the 76ft vessel pictured bottom with the seat added When it is packed away the boat can The 46yearold inventor started on the design in September last year following his trip to the coast and completed his first canoe in May He has now built two fibreglass Stakanoos which are on sale with Bristol Boats in Saltford and has a patent pending Woodward is then hoping to liaise with a canoe manufacturer and he has two more variants designed in a longer more traditional canoe shape with splashdecks fitted which he hopes to make in the future The Stakanoo is the brain child of 46yearold Stuart Woodward pictured in his invention from Bath Somerset Woodward wanted to design a portable alternative to roofmounted canoes Woodward s Stakanoo costs 465 Only two models are currently available in Bristol but the inventor plans to sell them across the country soon He said I was in Cornwall last year and saw lots of canoes being transported on the roofs of cars and thought there must be a better way of doing that I started designing a takeapart no more room than a large suitcase to make transport easier It fits in the car so the car has maximum fuel economy on motorways It s also much safer as it ca nt fall off the roof and it is easy to park in car parks as there is nothing overhanging It is easy to store when at home you can place it under the stairs in the garage or shed in the loft After two designs were not what I wanted I found a way of making the sections slot together with no bolts straps or tools I have taken it out on the river extensively and it paddles very well and turns in a tight circle It is a fun hybrid between a kayak and a canoe and you can you can just pack it up put into in your boot and away you go Financiallythreatened Swiss team Sauber have announced a partnership with three Russian companies which they hope will provide them with a solid foundation in the long term As part of the deal 17yearold Formula Renault 35 racer Sergey Sirotkin will be fasttracked into a Formula One race seat possibly as early as next year Sirotkin is the son of Oleg Sirotkin who heads up the National Institute of Aviation Technologies one of the trio of Russian companies involved in the partnership The other two are the Investment Corporation International Fund and the State Fund of Development of Northwest Russian Federation Sauber s future has been the subject of increasing paddock speculation in recent months Last week the Hinwilbased team said they would not stand in the way of their star German driver Nico Hulkenberg quitting the team amid reports that he has not been paid Team owner Peter Sauber denied those reports but admitted that the financial situation was uncomfortable and embarrassing Sauber who first entered to keep their heads above water since their last partner BMW decided to pull out of Formula One at the end of 2009 After a surprisingly strong campaign in 2012 they have struggled on track this year We are pleased to announce a partnership between the Investment Corporation International Fund the State Fund of Development of NorthWest Russian Federation and the National Institute of Aviation Technologies with Sauber Motorsport AG incorporating the promotion of the sport Formula 1 in Russia and jointly developing hightechnological solutions said a Sauber statement With the National Institute of Aviation Technologies one of the leading scientific research institutions in Russia the Sauber F1 team will benefit from the advanced knowhow of the frontend Russian scientists and engineers The objective of the partnership is to open up new perspectives and revenue streams by commercialising jointly developed technologies Sirotkin who has qualified in the top six five times in eight FR35 races this year will not appear in this week s young driver test at Silverstone as well as Hulkenberg But the intention is to have him in a race seat in time for next year s inaugural Russian Grand Prix in Sochi The partnership includes further activities for the promotion of the inaugural Formula One Grand Prix in Sochi in 2014 and attracting the talented young Russian generation towards motorsport said the statement In particular a development programme will be set up for the Russian driver Sergey Sirotkin to prepare him as a racing driver for the team in 2014 The inclusion in the deal of the St Petersburgbased State Fund of Development of Northwest Russian Federation has led to speculation that Sochi a Black Sea resort

on bail An analysis of GMAT integrated reasoning stats and implications for the future of MBA Admissions 6 things MBAs need to know This is a guest post by GMAT Pill resident GMAT adviser at BusinessBecause a leader inGMAT prep A year has passed since it s release and 196712 scores have been recorded Statistics have been compiled showing that the average mean IR score was 434 800 with a standard deviation of 21 Using a bell shaped distribution 95 of the scores should lie within 2 standard deviations 2 21 of the mean 434 Two standard deviations below the mean is 434 221 224 Two standard deviations above the mean is 434 221 644 However just note that this is not a normal distribution the intervals of the score only change by 1 KEY TAKEAWAYS 1 The IR score can tell a lot about an applicant The MBA admissions committees have developed that the IR section has been out for a year Admission committees can better compare how the score relates in comparison to an applicant s other stats The admission offices at the top business schools are always flooded with qualified applicants who have high GMAT scores Which ones stand out You may ask Students who received a high IR score will definitely set themselves apart Typically in the case of top business schools students with high GMAT Quant scores flood the admissions box The sheer number of students in the Q48 range can curve the scoring so that the difference between 2 quant questions can potentially drop scores beneath the 90th percentile Fortunately enough the admissions officer might actually prefer the Q48 student over the Q50 student if they knew the Q48 student has a stellar IR score while the Q50 student does not This is not currently the way it is but as IR becomes more and more accepted such a scenario could be quite plausible Let s take this between two possible candidates Candidate X Q48 IR 8 Candidate Y Q50 IR 5 Given this information Candidate X might appear to be the stronger more wellrounded candidate It should be interesting to note that the difference between GMAT scores and IR scores is quite apparent among Asian applicants Chinese and Indian applicants who scored high on IR will more likely have an edge over the competition than will applicants from other countries Why Simply because the discrepancy between average GMAT score and average IR score is greatest for applicants from these countries 2 Scholarships can be based upon IR Scores Those who are aware of the GMAT Pill s success stories platform may have noticed that several students were able to receive acceptance to top business schools across the world along with an MBA scholarship Such an accomplishment was made possible by a placing larger emphasis for the success of the overall GMAT including the IR section What makes the IR so important for possible scholarships to invest in a student They want to find strong hard working individuals who can process information and think on their feet The IR section is actually designed to assess these types of abilities A solid performance in all sections of the GMAT Quant Verbal AWA and IR will help you stand out for scholarship At the moment IR scores are only available after students receive their official score reports Following the Fall of 2013 test takers will find their IR score listed on the unofficial score report they receive at the test site 5 Earlier than 20 Days At the test site the administrators will tell you that the official score report will arrive in the mail within 20 days of the testing day Well actually GMAC is telling us the score report will more likely arrive in about a week On paper it s 20 days but do nt be surprised when you receive a mail from GMAC much earlier than that Debate has been stirring up about whether or not there should be a single score of 800 consisting of 4 subdivisions QuantVerbalAWAIR The 800 score is currently made up of 2 components Quant and Verbal If GMAC were to combine all 4 scores into one total 800 score it would represent a tremendous change to the current test scoring system Much discussion will be needed before any action is taken Even if it were approved these changes would take several years to correctly adjust ie the scoring scale GMAT Pill believes that simplifying everything into a single score is the appropriate decision The admissions office can better make sense of the official score report and the IR section will receive the recognition it deserves in the final 800 score This final 800 score is the score that students find compatible enough to compare with one another It is the score that top business school take into account during admission etc Although no promises have been made there is always a worth of data the GMAC organization exposed statistics that proved how different countries experience discrepancy between average GMAT scores and their corresponding IR scores What can we draw from this If Asian applicants the majority of whom are Chinese and Indian are commonly receiving stellar GMAT scores but inadequate IR scores then the Asians who score exceptionally well on BOTH the overall GMAT and the IR section will shine from the competition MBA programs want individuals who stand out from their peers and those who have obtained strong verbalquant score AND a high IR score have done just that While this is true for all applicants it is even more pronounced for Asian test takers Fun fact Test takers from Australiaand America experience the least discrepancy between their 800 GMAT score and their IR scores If a single test were able to determine a student s future graduate GPA the IR score would likely be the most precise Although the accuracy of this conclusion is based on limited data the been made that compares total 800 score AWA score undergraduate GPA and IR score to graduate GPA It appears that the IR score best predicts graduate GPA among the other tests Can the IR score influence a student s admission Although the IR score may not always tell which applicant should be accepted it DOES provide an idea of who to reject What do you mean The blue circle in the picture above reveals that among several test takers who scored a 650 or higher only a small percentage of them received a score of 1 2 or 3 2 3 and 6 respectively Commonly the case the admissions office will only look for applicants who received a GMAT score of 650 and above Among those applicants a few of them performed poorly on the IR section CAUTION Be consistent with your scores Do nt have a 650 or higher GMAT score and aninsufficient IR score alongside it way With that being said Asian applicants who received a score of 650 or higher should put in the extra time to do well on the IR section Although scoring an 8 would be fantastic it is not required A strong score of 6 or 7 should be able to do the trick All MBA programs would like to see a high IR score not just the upper tier programs The total percentage of test takers who receive a score of 1 2 or 3 is quite high The possibility of scoring a 1 2 or 3 is 6 10 and 14 respectively That means that the total possibility of an applicant scoring a 1 2 or 3 is 30 IR Scores can also predict a future career path With only a year of information the initial surveys reports MBAs that go into Consulting Operations and Finance have higher IR scores than the MBAs who go into human resources marketing or general management GMAC it was announced that top consulting firms like McKinsey and Bain have taken interest in knowing an applicant s IR scores Consultants also evaluate candidates through IR Scores How would that be possible The IR section was designed to assess the same exact skills that consultants use on the job Consultants management consultants for example need to understand what the overall goal is and its blueprint After crunching a series of numbers a basic pattern must be found and steps need to be planned in order to obtain the objective Based on previous experience as a managing consultant at Booz amp Company I can confirm how essential IR skills are on the job It s not surprising that top consulting firms would want to know an applicant s IR scores There s no doubt that consulting firms would want students with high GPAs and high GMAT scores However in the forthcoming future it is very likely that top consulting firms will see IR scores in the likely be asked for BOTH their GMAT and their IR scores on their resumes Future management consultants set on their goal should absolutely put the work in now and study for the IR section In Conclusion The MBA admissions committee has developed a better understanding of what the IR score represents and how to compare it to an applicant s other stats Be sure to remember some inside information about the IR section Asian applicants experience a large discrepancy between their 800 GMAT score and their IR scores Very few applicants perform outstanding on the overall score and perform miserably on the IR section do nt be one of them Demographic background can play a role with IR score importance Some test takers can receive a good enough IR score of at least 4 and get into the school of their choice Applicants who are aiming for a scholarship should try to score as high as possible in all categories verbal quant AWA and IR As Pill instructor James received a full tuition MBA scholarship to LondonBusinessSchool as a result of his excellent scores across the board Corporate recruiting not just MBA admissions can be influenced by IR scores High IR scores will definitely impress management consulting firms After the fall of 2013 the unofficial score report will carry your IR score Debate has been stirred about whether or not there should be a single score of 800 consisting of 4 subdivisions QuantVerbalAWAIR The GMAT community hopes to see this plan take fruition Zeke Lee the 98ile in 2 weeks guy from Stanford is the founder of the GMAT

to launch a bunch of free online courses that could potentially help 100000150000 people a year get highquality education and make them jobready The courses will be offered using the model of massive open online courses MOOCs which is globally creating an upheaval in the world of higher education The first three courses in computer science are expected to roll out this October This programme is particularly relevant to India because of the high number of young students who need to be educated and trained says Lakshmi Narayanan vicechairman of Cognizant MOOCs make highquality education from top universities accessible to anyone anywhere in the world online and for free The model was rolled out in early 2012 backtoback by two startups Udacity and Coursera both emerging out of Stanford University This was followed by edX MITHarvard s online courses platform About 15 faculty members are currently designing the course We are currently working out the details of the programme in consultation with Nasscom says Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi director IITMadras We are also hoping to rope in more than 500 mentors on a voluntary basis from industry and academia adds AK Ray professor of the Centre for Educational Technology at IITKharagpur This is the biggest industryacademia partnership to help students and professionals access topquality course content and meet specific industry demands For the first time students from both rural areas and metros will have access to the same content channel tests experts and certification says Cognizant s Narayanan People who take the courses will be eligible to write proctored exams for a minimal fee and get certificates For the computer science courses IIT will give certification For the foundation courses industry will give certificates It could also be a joint certification with IITs Students from the second year onwards in science and engineering offered multiple times a year says Andrew Thangaraj associate professor of electrical engineering at IITMadras It will make a difference in their career progress Google is providing its Course Builder platform for hosting MOOCs HackerRank will provide their web portal where students can practise their programming assignments and get them verified and graded Till now IITs have been offering open courseware on the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning NPTEL This is a repository of video lectures created by professors of the seven older IITs and IISCBangalore available to anyone anywhere in the world on Youtube etc However NPTEL does not give any certification neither does it have any interaction or synchronised classes In the next phase of NPTEL all these seven IITs and industry have joined hands to offer courses on the webbased MOOCs platform which will also offer certification Cognizant has been discussing this idea with academia and industry for the past three years Cognizant will make available infrastructure at its training enable students to take tests and get certified says Narayanan Initially IITs will run three mini modules of a computer science course including programming algorithm and data structures Each module will have 12 lectures and there will be a total of 36 lectures over 12 weeks Going forward the plan is to repeat this model in VLSI very large scale integration embedded systems and other branches of engineering and general sciences Industry is getting involved with inputs on applicability and problemsolving aspects with the aim of making students more industry and jobready says Sandhya Chintala executive director sector skills council Nasscom who is leading the programme for the industry association Industry has also shared a brief on the skills needed for 67 entrylevel job roles IITs will make these available on MOOC platform This is the first time that industry has articulated the performance of an individual at an entrylevel job role This clarity will help formal or nonformal training institutions to Remainder books the unsold editions of books from Indian and international publishers are in huge demand There are books on tables books in cartons and books on the floor They come in every size shape and colour hardbound paperbacked and leatherwrapped Some with cracking spines and others with yellowing pages and still others spanking new The walls around stand unadorned and there s no airconditioned comfort no cozy cafeteria on the side nor sofas to sink into What there is though are books by the lakhs mostly unsold editions from Indian and international publishers stretching across all genres and sold at generous discounts Kochi hosts two such yearround book sales Blossoms on Press Club Road and Kerala Book House on Chittoor Road Reselling in bulk When books grow old or remain unsold for long at bookstores they are sent back to publishers and distributors who resell them in bulk to the unorganised book market Of the English books market in Kerala explains Abdul Latheef who has run Blossoms for the last seven years With Indian publishers their leftovers can be bought at Daryaganj in Delhi where most have their headquarters while international publishers ship their books by the container to port cities such as Mumbai or Chennai says KM Basheer who owns Kerala Book House Many book store owners in Kerala are veering toward this market because there s a rich supply and maintenance overheads are few says Basheer It s difficult to sustain a bookshop these days because people buy brand new books at lower prices on online portals which even home deliver he says Thus the biggest advantage remainderbook sales have is their discounted prices We only need to cover transportation costs and the price paid to the publisher So we are able to offer up to 70 per cent discount on old editions and up to 20 per cent even on recentlypublished books People come to us because they know they can find a decent quality of books and a wide variety One of the challenges such sales face is display space says Basheer Since books are bought and sold in bulk there s a massive stock with the owner always and exhibiting it requires large halls Besides his permanent space on Chittoor Road he once had a branch on Warriam Road which he had to close down due to high rent Nowadays I take places on lease for a few weeks at a time display over five lakh books at once and then move to another venue he says He is currently hosted at a hall beside Kalyan Silks The other difficulty is in procuring manpower observes Latheef We need people who are familiar with books can sort them into the right genres and can pick out the right book in the right edition when customers enquire says Latheef The upside to the business of unsold books is the wide variety possible since the focus is nt only on latest releases It s therefore common to find four or five editions to the latest often with a cover featuring the book s movie version While Basheer stocks his books in piles by price ranging upwards from Rs 20 per book Blossoms categorises them by genre There s everything from literary fiction to commercial fiction travel art film photography academic discourse biography comics and children s books Our popular sections are the art and cinema ones because there are many international works here which otherwise would be unavailable at stores or exorbitantly priced says Latheef Running a book sale needs one to be clued in to the current trends in the market latest works by authors and new editions released by publishers says Latheef I keep updated constantly and I stock according to customer requests he adds His clientele are primarily youth shopping on a budget or professionals and technicians in the film and photography fields looking to update their skills There are also many book collectors searching for rare or first editions as well as those nor Basheer stock textbooks though but both supply fiction and nonfiction to school and private libraries as well as coffee shops and cafes Both sales also function as lendinglibraries of a sort since they buy back their books at 50 per cent the price sold That way readers can take however long they d like with a book without paying fines for overshooting duedates Their reading cost is hence lower says Latheef He adds For a small city like Kochi the size of the reading population is at par with large metros It s that that keeps us going This is the first of three short stories by Seetha Ravi on the musical trinity Syama Sastri Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar The stories have been translated by Prabha Sridevan former judge M Think small is the new mantra of currency forgers Wonder why Machines meant for detecting fake currency notes are installed at bank branches and certain retail outlets But these machines as a routine are never used to verify the genuineness of currency notes of the denominations of Rs50 Rs20 or Rs10 And the racketeers cash in on the lack of scrutiny to distribute fakes The RBI has issued guidelines to the banks on detection of fake currency notes Guidelines do not talk about reporting currency notes of denominations below Rs100 making it easier for the banks to hush up the matter Fake notes of lower denominations had been detected in the past The total number of forged notes in circulation in the below Rs100 category is left to one s imagination as no official account is available except for the few cases registered by the police Quite a few such cases have reached various courts of law in Kerala but the percentage of fake ones coming to the notice of authorities are unable to replicate the watermark and intaglio or other key security features of the original currency notes absence of rigorous scrutiny enables the forged notes to change hands A senior official of RBI said a few cases of fake currency notes of lower denominations had come to the notice of the apex bank but the official failed to explain the magnitude of the problem The value of circulated counterfeit currency notes in the category is negligible in the economy according to the official The paper used by RBI for printing currency notes is imported and is not available in the market the official added Scanning and printing on colour printers are the two main ways adopted by forgers With machines that can replicate documents in colours which look identical to the original getting printouts of currencies is not a difficult task Colour balance and brightness can be adjusted in high quality machines to produce lifelike images A senior official of an international company engaged in marketing various electronic products including colour copiers and printers in a machine which were detected during maintenance work in Kochi recently The incident hints at the possibility of currency counterfeiting operations being carried out by means of colour copiers However Alok Bharadwaj EVP Canon India told The Hindu over phone that his company s colour copiers have an inbuilt mechanism to detect currency notes The copy will have lines across the printed copy Even in the case of certificates the product will have a copy mark High resolution colour copiers also have embedded features to store images of copied documents making it possible to be tracked down if required Prevention is better than cure and why to track the persons later without knowing the quantities copied The scammers could print them outside the country and bring ithem in Without knowing the quantities counterfeited how the officials could claim the value of circulated counterfeit currency notes in the category is negligible in the economy The article also says A senior official of RBI said a few to the notice of the apex bank but the official failed to explain the magnitude of the problem Is it a responsible answer from a RBI senior official Machines for detection of all fake currencies must be introduced immediately and all small denomination currencies must be checked and fake ones removed from circulation and accounted for Minnie Driver s war hero dad cheated on wife with her mother Minnie Driver s father cheated on his wife with the Hollywood actress mother ANI Jul

Analysts SmartPorn India s other mobile revolution That smut flood is sparking a serious debate about the impact on society We re raising up an army of rapists in India by not warring against internet pornography Abishek Clifford who runs a moral awareness program for Indian colleges called Rescue told GlobalPost He s not the only one concerned Since the December gang rape of a Delhi student who died from internal injuries sustained during the attack the entire country has been wrestling with what many regard as a spike in sexual violence Although possessing or watching porn is permitted in India distributing it is illegal And now the authorities are moving to crack down on web porn even as in many other areas the country grows more liberal in its attitude toward sex Flood of free porn Ancient India had no qualms about graphic depictions of sex Consider the luxurious illustrations of the Kama Sutra or the carvings on the 1000yearold temples But until recently modern India has been decidedly more prudish In the 80s and 90s films with lascivious dialogue and a few shots of buxom women in wet saris were considered softcore porn Bollywood did nt even dare show kissing until a few years back And the country s first real porn star was a cartoon Now suddenly affordable smartphones have put hardcore porn in the palms of millions According to statistics from Manwin Holding the Luxembourgbased owner of the world s largest free porn sites YouPorn and Pornhub India s 150 millionodd internet users visit those two sites alone at a clip of around 2 million hits per day The presence of Indianthemed content naked desi babes in bath is one of the few printable titles and advertisements confirms that the multibillion dollar industry has taken note Meanwhile reported incidents of rape have nearly doubled since 1995 when the internet first came to India according to the National spiked 12 percent since cheap smart phones hit the market two years ago although it s impossible to parse how much of that increase stems from the greater willingness of victims to come forward To some that correlation signals causality Pornography is en masse perverting the lifestyles and behaviors of young people in India said Rescue s Clifford citing Rescue surveys in which college students confessed that each week they watch an average of two hours of violent porn More porn more rape The media and the authorities too have been quick to draw a connection between the increased availability of pornography and the apparent increase in sexual violence A recent article in India Today a leading weekly magazine drew attention to the prevalence of rape fantasy porn and other violent clips at local download centers kiosks where entrepreneurs illegally load porn onto customers thumb drives and memory chips And it cited Google AdWords statistics to point out that Mobile phones were search with the keyword rape over the past year and search keywords included Indian girls raped raping video raping stories raped in public little girl raped raping mom father raping daughter and raped to death In June the department of telecommunications banned 39 websites all hosted abroad that allow users to share pornographic content And this month a parliamentary committee was formed to explore ways to block internet pornography altogether in response to the latest of many petitions that have demanded a blanket ban But is the flood of smut really to blame for an epidemic of violent gang rapes If so India may not exactly be an outlier The country s 41 million monthly searches for the keyword rape amounts to one search per month for every 30 internet users In comparison US mobile users also searched for rape an average of key phrases like women getting raped men being raped and kids being raped That s one search per month per 60 internet users For both countries those figures include not only the apparently heinous phrases highlighted by India Today but also every search for rape counseling rape news reports rape crisis centers and so on In India s case for instance there were an average of around 100000 searches for raping video or one search per month for every 1500 internet users The average was 246000 searches for Delhi gang rape and 90500 for rape victims Incidentally Google indicates that it removes suspected commercial and child pornography from its products and reports criminal activity to the authorities A quick search suggests the raperelated search terms do nt return graphic pictures and videos although a disturbing proportion of the

species successfully relocated in a Limpopo experiment Cape Town Coal miners are often considered environmental villains for their impact on natural systems but one mining company is winning green kudos for a project that is both highly unusual and a first for the subcontinent the translocation of indigenous baboon spiders Their experiment that produced highly positive results will help others reestablish a fuller range of biodiversity and hence promote functioning ecosystems in areas rehabilitated after mining and other highly disruptive industrial activities The spider relocation project was initiated by mining group Exxaro Resources near Lephalale in Limpopo and involved two species the goldenbrown baboon spider Augacephalus junodi and burst horned baboon spider Ceratogyrus darlingi These longlived spiders are common and not endangered but are protected by biodiversity legislation because they re illegally targeted for the pet trade The relocation project team consisted of the mining company Game Reserve Marius Fuls and entomologist Dr Dawid Jacobs Smit explained that the project had been initiated because of construction activities at its Grootegeluk mine that was being expanded to provide coal for Eskom s new Medupi power station nearby Creation of a new burrow for one the translocated spiders Pictures ExxaroSUPPLIED The spiders had been spotted during the vegetationclearing phase and it had been decided to move them to a safer area There were three parts to the experiment l Finding the most effective method of baboon spider relocation by testing different options including the provision of artificial burrows 200 releases l Seeing whether the two species could construct their own burrows after relocation 80 releases l Testing the findings by relocating 60 spiders to a rehabilitation site where they had originally occurred but disappeared after industrial disturbance The spiders were caught by Lephalale resident and spider expert Marius Koekemoer and moved to an 800 hectare section of Manketti Soil augers were used to create the fixed over each burrow to prevent spiders from escaping and to keep predators out The researchers were delighted to find a 95 percent acceptance of artificial burrows within the first week and the 60 spiders relocated on Eskom s rehabilitated Matimba power station ash dump in order to test the results of the research project also fared well We were surprised and absolutely thrilled with a 95 percent acceptance rate said Fuls who said that releasing the spiders without a readymade burrow was not very successful because they were usually eaten by predators such as baboons mongooses birds and other spiders before they could build a shelter for themselves Eskom was very excited by the results a construction company had heard about the project and brought through a number of spiders they d found while working on a pipeline project in the Lephalale area and another mining company had also expressed interest in the project he added I m really proud to have been involved It s given us area we do have mitigation methods thereby giving us an opportunity to meet our commitment to sustainability Cape Argus Comment Guidelines Has a comment offended you Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the righthand side Click triangle and select Flag

so much flak REUTERSOfficers must often make impossible decisions for their troops such as whether to wear body armour protective against some fire but also cumbersome hindering a soldiers mobility Picture Reuters What happened in the CAR has sparked debate about how best and when to use body armour writes Helmoed R mer Heitman The haunting of Bangui That s what you might call the ongoing controversy over how our troops were or were not protected when they went to war in the Central African Republic CAR in March Colonel Renier Doibi Coetzee a senior South African Special Forces officer has triggered a debate after speaking at the Land Forces Africa conference attended by SANDF and other African officers attach s and defence industry experts in Pretoria Two hundred South African troops fought more than 3 000 rebels for nearly two days The question now being debated in the army as in other armies We want to reduce fatal injuries to an absolute minimum Now important discussion has to be had in the military about how to wear the flak jackets and the quality of our soldiers uniforms A great deal of the noise is being made by people who were not there to hear what Coetzee said at the press conference and who have not tried to fight wearing body armour The points he made as I understood them were that several soldiers survived multiple hits on their body armour punishment some armour would not handle However some of the troops said we need better flak jackets that are more practical to wear and that we need to look at the type of body armour we issue and the drills for when and how to wear it Those same points are made by British Canadian German and American officers in open defence journals and at conferences and in conversation with analysts It is therefore difficult to understand why the Department of Defence should have remarks one would expect from a serious military professional Clearly whoever drafted that statement did not have the full picture The question of when to wear body armour and particularly when to insert the ceramic plates into the basic ballistic jacket is subject to lively discussion among officers and soldiers of many armies involved in recent combat operations in various theatres The problem is that body armour is heavy hot and uncomfortable with the result that it both reduces the soldier s endurance and his or her agility on the battlefield While wearing body armour may protect against rifle fire that hits the ceramic plates which only cover the heart and lung area it will not protect against heavy machinegun fire or against hits elsewhere on the body that can also prove fatal The very flak jacket that will stop a rifle bullet that hits the soldier in the chest or back can also so hamper his agility that he becomes vulnerable to being shot in the head or in the body more time to aim with care There have been several such cases in Afghanistan for instance The weight and discomfort of wearing full armour can so exhaust soldiers particularly in hot weather or rough terrain as to render them incapable of catching more fleetfooted with no body armour to weigh them down guerrillas after a contact or to escape when the need arises as it sometimes will for the bravest and besttrained soldier There have been several such situations in Afghanistan that are the basis for considerable discussion in the British and US armies One of the key questions is that of an officer having the moral courage to instruct his soldiers to take off their body armour to be more agile mobile and effective and what then happens if he loses a soldier killed But the alternative is often to plod along take cover when drawing fire return it as best as possible and then resume plodding along which rather defeats the purpose of patrolling Looking at consider the practicalities The soldiers were engaged in fighting albeit off and on for almost 35 hours That will have exhausted them with the high daytime temperatures not helping The paratroopers who suffered all of the fatal casualties were fighting in rough and hilly terrain and twice had to counterattack to recapture a feature west of the road they were blocking Later they had to fight and evade a vastly stronger force in the builtup part of Bangui itself Both situations demand agility and endurance In those circumstances it would be quite understandable if some decided to remove the heavy ceramic plates Particularly junior leaders machine gunners grenadiers or radio operators the former because they need the agility to do their job the latter because of the weight they have to carry The Special Forces group faced quite different situations both that morning when they were ambushed on the road to Damara and then that afternoon when they fought a rearguard action against On the one hand they had more vehicles and fought mainly from and around their vehicles which will have been not quite as exhausting while on the other they were fighting against enemies who came to within 10m of them on both sides of the road on several occasions and were not in a position to take proper cover leaving them exposed to fire much of the time and often at very close range Despite all those factors as far as I am aware only a very small number of our soldiers were killed by a bullet hit to the area that would be covered by the ceramic plates which suggests that most were wearing their full armour and that it was effective Or if some of the soldiers indeed took out the ceramic plates that this so improved their agility that they were not hit in the first place It may also be that the Special Forces use different body armour and that it was their soldiers forced to fight lived to tell the tale But is their body armour suitable for use by other soldiers of normal fitness and would they have worn it if they had not had vehicles and fought mainly from and around them It might simply be too heavy for general use That I believe was the point Coetzee was making The fighting around Bangui has provided the defence force and the army in particular with practical experience of fighting in very difficult circumstances There are many lessons to learn from the afteraction reports Some of those lessons will concern what body armour to use and when it should be worn and when not and here we need to be as open in our discussions as other armies because secret debriefings do not often lead to innovative solutions And it is innovative thinking and open exchange of experience and ideas with other armies that is required if we are to develop body armour that is effective and practical giving both wider area protection and greater agility The because every battle situation will be different but these are things we must study and evaluate and we need to understand that soldiers senior commanders field commanders and ordinary soldiers will often have to take those decisions under pressure and in situations of great danger And that there will be times when the practicalities of a situation will force them to act against procedures back to moral courage of which General George Patton said it is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men We must learn from experience and that demands officers who speak out and that demands that the rest of us listen and take note Helmoed R mer Heitman is a defence

Aboitiz Group power supply deals MANILA The National Grid Corp of the Philippines NGCP expects the cost of ancillary services AS or reserve power to go down by more than a third after it signed supply agreements with Aboitiz Power Corp NGCP president Henry Sy Jr said the ASPAs will help lower electricity rates We are constantly looking for ways to lessen AS cost by engaging power generators who are technically capable and willing to provide AS at a rate acceptable to gridusers Sy said The ERC has already given its go signal to the ASPAs to allow NGCP to augment the existing reserves of the Luzon grid amid increasing demand The available power reserves are insufficient to comply with the required levels of contingency and dispatchable reserves prescribed in the Philippine Grid Code The agreements will also address the possible AS supply deficiency during the dry season when hydropower plants have low water reserve By entering into an agreement reliability of the supply of reserves necessary to maintain the quality and frequency of electricity transmitted to distribution utilities and other gridusers NGCP spokesperson Cynthia D PerezAlabanza said The ERCapproved AS rate indicates that charges may be 3040 percent less than the existing rates for the same amount of reserves The old AS rate is P029 per kilowatthour while the new one P018 We continue to push for less expensive ancillary services to make sure that we only get the more efficient and affordable ancillary services providers We want to serve our grid customers better We will secure the reliability and stability of the grid but we will not burden the endconsumers Sy said The ERC also granted NGCP the authority to schedule the contracted AS capacities with the reminder that the grid operator shall optimize the economic and technical dispatch of the said resources In scheduling the grid operator shall consider the AS provider with the least cost for the reserve needed to maintain the quality ERC said Further NGCP is directed to submit a monthly computation of AS rates Ancillary Services as defined in Section 4 b of the EPIRA are those services that are necessary to support the transmission of capacity and energy from resources to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission system in accordance with good utility practice and the Grid Code AS are needed to regulate the frequency of transmitted electricity to avoid fluctuations and to help the grid adapt to sudden loss of power supply thus preventing massive blackouts AS also provides assistance to backup generating plants to recover from a shutdown and augment the grid As grid operator NGCP is tasked to bill and collect AS charges based on the ERCapproved rates These charges however do not form a part of NGCP s revenues and are only passon charges remitted entirely to the generation companies from which the AS are sourced NGCP is a privately owned corporation in charge of operating maintaining and

unlikely the 30yearold National Security Agency leaker alone will sour ties irrevocably between two powers that both have moved past their halfcentury Cold War for global supremacy After Snowden left the transit zone of Moscow s airport and officially entered Russia on Thursday the White House declared itself extremely disappointed and suggested President Barack Obama would reconsider his autumn summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow American lawmakers threatened worse from demanding Russia forfeit its right to host a summit of the world s biggest economies to questioning whether Washington and Moscow can now cooperate at all Some in Congress have spoken of boycotting next year s Winter Olympics in the southern Russian city of Sochi Russia s action today is a disgrace and a deliberate effort to embarrass the United States It is a slap in the face of all Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin s Russia Retaliation against Russia comes at a cost however Putin has proven over more than a decade in power that he ll respond to perceived offenses from the United States whether in the form of a missile defense network in Europe or US support for prodemocracy demonstrations in Ukraine Georgia and other neighboring nations And for all the tough talk in Washington the US knows it needs Putin to promote a range of American national security interests and has tried to temper its reaction to Putin s provocations World Article MRec pagematch 1 sectionmatch 1 Without the Kremlin s help the US would have a harder time containing terrorist groups in the South Caucasus ensuring supply routes to US troops in Afghanistan and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons And it would have zero chance of persuading Syrian President Bashar Assad to join rebels in peace talks to end a war that has killed 100000 people includes has pulled Washington and Moscow onto opposing sides The administration s first reaction to Snowden s asylum was condemnatory but cautious We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States White House press secretary Jay Carney said The US has demanded that Russia send Snowden home to face prosecution for espionage over his leaks that revealed widespread US telephone and Internet surveillance For more than a month Russian authorities left him stranded at the airport after he flew there from Hong Kong unwilling to grant him temporary residence or travel documents that he could use without a valid US passport to travel on to Latin America The saga ended Thursday when Snowden was granted a oneyear stay However even Putin has seemed intent on limiting the fallout Before the decision he said asylum would be contingent on Snowden refraining from leaking any more materials suggesting that States he did nt want to harbor a fugitive who would seek to flaunt his safe status beyond the reach of American law enforcement Paul Saunders executive director of the conservative Center for National Interest think tank said the administration erred in exerting worldwide pressure to prevent Snowden from finding a new home The administration backed Moscow into a corner thinking that would press them to give in he said In fact it just made them harden their position Speaking to reporters Carney declined to outline what consequences Russia might face He suggested only that Obama was reconsidering his upcoming teteatete with Putin which was supposed to focus on the Syrian civil war and righting a relationship with Russia that the US president already tried to reset once after taking office in 2009 Canceling the meeting would be a surprise however considering that Obama was willing to meet despite Russia s ban on US adoptions its crackdown on prodemocracy groups and gay rights organizations regime Carney said Moscow s decision undermined USRussian law enforcement cooperation that had improved since two ethnic Chechens were blamed for the Boston Marathon bombings American officials will reach out to their Russian counterparts Carney said but he pointedly refused to detail any diplomatic repercussions for Moscow Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer spelled out one calling on Obama to recommend moving the G20 summit of world leaders in St Petersburg on Sept 56 Russia has stabbed us in the back and each day that Mr Snowden is allowed to roam free is another twist of the knife Schumer said The Senate already had been working on sanctions against any country prepared to help Snowden avoid extradition to the United States The measure introduced last week by Sen Lindsey Graham RSC demands that the State Department coordinate with lawmakers on setting penalties against nations offering Snowden asylum The Senate panel backed Graham s proposal without objections MANILA Philippines The Philippine National Police

photographed by WTI Over the last two months we have discovered three new species only with the help of these camera traps None of these four including the squirrel were mentioned in the latest faunal records published by the Zoological Survey of India ZSI which mentions 53 species of mammals said Santosh Tiwari Field Director of the Tiger Reserve These discoveries only go on to prove that the once neglected reserve is on a revival path with the joint activities by the Forest Department and NGOs in association with the communities who Samir Kumar Sinha WTI s Regional Head for Bihar The camera trapping by WWFIndia was carried out as a part of a monitoring exercise in collaboration with Department of Environment amp Forests Bihar and National Tiger Conservation Authority NTCA Government of India WWFIndia has been working in partnership with the Bihar Forest Department to monitor Valmiki s tigers and with partners in Nepal is implementing a transboundary approach to conservation We are excited by these discoveries Valmiki has excellent potential for tiger recovery and given its contiguity with the Chitwan National Park in Nepal will be a critical site for undertaking transboundary approaches for tiger conservation WWF will strengthen its partnership with the management of Valmiki and intensify conservation efforts said Dr Dipankar Ghose Director Species and Landscapes WWFIndia The tiger monitoring work in Valmiki is part of the larger tiger survey being undertaken in India and Nepal across the entire Terai Arc Landscape for the first time WWFIndia is supporting the government in their efforts to develop Valmiki Forest Department since 2003 WTI s Valmiki Conservation Project helped establish the presence of a viable population of tigers bringing focus back to this formerly neglected tiger reserve in the mid2000s The Project carries out a comprehensive approach to conservation including studies on tigers and habitat recovery activities it is supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service USFWS Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union NABU and Sir Dorabji Tata Trust SDTT The project also works with the communities involving them in conservation and reducing their dependence on forest resources particularly within the villages in the Done valley that forms an incursion into the core of the tiger reserve These species have been previously recorded in the neighbouring Chitwan National Park in Nepal which forms the northern boundary of Valmiki Reserve The ZSI has recorded 10 species of amphibians 27 species of reptiles and 75 species of insects in Valmiki including the gaur Bos gaurus and the Indian wild dog Cuon alpinus which are not found Also called honey dog for its fondness for sweet food this mammal has a brown coat that darkens toward and on the tail and its throat and chin are yellowish orange It is listed in the CITES III appendix in India Share this Kentucky education officials consideration of Next Generation Science Standards gained national attention last month when The Huffington Post and others picked up on criticism of evolution and climate change during a public hearings on the matter Here s the latest The Kentucky Board of Education on Thursday rejected that public opposition and approved a final report from the education department on the new science standards The state received thousands of responses during the public comment period A petition with 3700 names was signed in support of the standards and Kentucky education officials include several scientific organizations that have shown their support At the same time the state received over onehundred identical emails that opposed inclusion of evolution and characterized it as a theory and not a fact A Statement of Consideration is what the board approved on Thursday It s the formal document that includes recommendations for any changes to the standards based off public comments The regulation now heads to Kentucky s Administrative Regulation Review Committee new standards would go into effect during the 20142015 school year Updating science standards is part of Kentucky s education reforms The Next Generation Science Standards were developed by 26 states including Kentucky State officials say the standards are based on new scientific research and include what students are expected to learn while providing the blueprint for success in postsecondary education The standards have critics outside of Kentucky and received a C grade overall from the Fordham Institute a conservative education think tank organization for its lack of rigor but many educators reject this claim Fordham also says the new standards are inferior to Kentucky s current standards Click here to see its final report Below the statement of consideration responds to public comments Evolution Citing support from dozens of scientific organizations Kentucky education department officials rejected comments opposing evolution in the new standards saying it s the fundamental unifying theory that underlies all the life sciences It goes on to the scientific community regarding the legitimacy of evolution as a scientific idea KDE also notes that the concept of evolution already exists in the current version of the Kentucky Core Academic Standards for Science and has been assessed since 2006 Creationism and Intelligent Design KDE rejected comments related to including intelligent design in the new standards because they lack scientific support The overwhelming majority of scientists do not consider creationism intelligent design the report says Officials also point to court decisions that have repeatedly declared teaching creationism and intelligent design as unconstitutional The new standards no not attempt to explain the origin of life while creationism and intelligent design do the report reads Climate Change KDE officials say the standards do not advocate any particular public response policy change or civic action related to climate change but it does ask that schools include climate research and studies within the standards framework The standards ask students to consider the evidence for the factors influencing climate change to tailor their curricula to fit their needs Latest Trends in Intelligent Robot EndofArm Tooling The role of robot endofarm tooling has never been more important With robot users demanding more versatility in their processes manufacturers are under pressure to deliver flexible intelligent endofarm tooling EOAT that adds value to the overall system From servo grippers and hybrid tooling to advanced tool changers and control modules today s EOAT is not only easier to implement and easier to use it s down right smart Applicationspecific grippers are bringing robotics within arm s length of a broader audience to new industries and small to midsized businesses that would have considered it out of reach just a year ago A new breed of anthropomorphic end effector not only plays nice in the lab it s finding its way onto the shop floor And a magnetic gripper that s the polar opposite of anything on the market is attracting fans Pick and place weld deburr apply material inspect and locate loadunload and do it the gauntlet and manufacturers are raising their hands to the challenge Flexible Intelligent EOAT With a glut of homogenous grippers on the market leading manufacturers are working to differentiate themselves from the commodityladen torrent Endofarm tooling manufacturers are asking themselves how they can add more value to their EOAT The way we re adding value is with smarter and more flexible end effectors EOAT that actually acts with intelligence rather than placing the burden on the robot itself says Henry Loos Application Engineer at Applied Robotics Inc in Glenville New York As a result we re starting to see lines of demarcation among different manufacturers and customers are shopping around more By moving intelligence out to the endofarm tooling and allowing the end effector to make some positioning decisions on its own independent of the robot we wind up with a system that the robot programmer can then program more quickly and easily says Loos People are pumping out applications much quicker upfront for this intelligent endofarm tooling you ll save tons in expensive programming labor he says And when you need to make a quick change to the system the faster your EOAT allows you to make that change the less downtime you will have and the less you will be paying your process engineers to reprocess the station Servo Grippers Flexibility is one of the biggest differentiators and the common denominator in the latest EOAT trends Robot users are asking for endofarm tooling that can handle multiple sizes of similar materials or end effectors to handle different kinds of materials or hybrid technologies that tackle multiple tasks with the same EOAT Our customers want to utilize the same tool for various sized bags without having to use some kind of manual width adjustment says John Westbeld Engineering Manager at SAS Automation LLC in Xenia Ohio Our new Servo Bag Gripper SBG50 incorporates a servomotor with a belt and pulley system to automatically adjust onthefly between different bag widths operate one robot on two lines with different sized bags It will adjust the width onthefly from one side to the other as you palletize two different lines at the same time with one robot and one EOAT This video shows the servo bag gripper in action handling different sized bags Westbeld says that the robot must be preconfigured with a 7th axis controller in order to control a servomotor It s more user friendly for the teach pendant and programming because the servodriven EOAT shows up as a 7th axis just like any other axis on the robot It s more work on our end but much more user friendly By building the user friendliness right into the equipment it s also easier on the integrator he adds There s less programming knowledge involved If any portion of the project can be simplified they can install it faster and troubleshoot it easier Applied Robotics Loos extols the benefits of servobased flexible grippers a part meaning the robot programmer does nt have to hit that perfect spot all the time to grip the part It saves an incredible amount of time Servo also gives you an almost infinite range of options in positioning Whereas an air cylinderbased clamp is either open or it s closed You re either grabbing or you re not grabbing With servo you can engage a part that is slightly irregular or packaged in a slightly irregular way This video shows a compact servodriven gripper used for biomedical applications where tight tolerances are often required It has to fit in tight spaces move precisely and handle product very gently says Loos In tight spaces like handling titration trays tubes etc the consequences of a dropped item are very steep Modular Vacuum Grippers Endofarm tooling designed to handle various kinds of materials in varying shapes and sizes is also trending Many of our customers are looking for lighterweight tooling especially when they want the more flexibility in the EOAT often means more components and more weight but at same time they still want to use the smallest robot possible says Volker Schmitz President of Schmalz Inc in Raleigh North Carolina This is especially true in the consumer goods industry where the packaging is changing so often he adds Customers are asking for tooling that will not only handle their current packaging but packaging two to three years down the road but we do nt know what it s going to look like in the future Schmalz recently launched its largearea vacuum gripping system the FMP The patentpending vacuum bars as Schmitz refers to them are designed to handle various materials such as wood metal sheet glass cardboard or plastic with different shapes surfaces and dimensions With suction cups the problem is that the cup has to completely cover a product explains Schmitz If it hits half on a box or pouch it s not generating vacuum and it s just leaking air The vacuum bar does nt care where the product is located It s kind of like a vacuum cleaner in how anything underneath it gets sucked up But it does nt have to perfectly seal around everything that it s gripping The vacuum bars can handle a lot of different shaped and sized products without having to change the gripper If the product is a sheet metal or a glass or these paver stones as shown that stay level or flat then we can pick those up with an engineered foam and that s usually the best product because it s the most versatile on those kinds of materials Hybrid Tooling Another trend is hybrid tooling that combines multiple gripper technologies in one endofarm tool Customers want one universal gripper for all parts says Schmitz So that s what we try to focus on is engineering an EOAT that will grip all we sometimes have to use a combination of different technologies all in one tool For example part of the tool will have suction Another part will have a mechanical clamping arm around it This video shows a hybrid EOAT in a palletizing demo moving entire layers of different materials Advanced Tool Changers No stranger to the EOAT market tool changers have continued to get more flexible robust and easier to use But with these advancements come new challenges We re seeing demand for tool changers that have the ability to pass through more utilities and even more challenging needs like incorporating vision and different bus networks says Catherine Morris Director of Automotive Sales at ATI Industrial Automation in Apex North Carolina Tool changers have had electric and air passthrough for awhile says Dan Peretz VP North America of IPR Robotics Inc in Troy Michigan The trend now is allowing other materials to pass through the tool changer IPR has developed patented tool that is paint PVC or wax There are a variety of different materials being applied in various applications We re expanding into areas requiring components that can stand up to extreme heat extreme cold highpressure water applications both for highpressure cleaning and underwater applications and other extremes such as radiation says Bob Little ATI s CEO ATI recently introduced its largest tool changer the QC1510 HeavyDuty Tool Changer which can handle payloads up to 4080 kg The modular construction allows integration with applications requiring highpower coolant servo a variety of bus networks and discrete signal capabilities by incorporating separate modules that can be mounted on any of nine available flats Along with the largest ATI also recently developed its smallest tool changer The QC001 Micro Tool Changer weighs less than 122 grams while handling up to 14kg payloads Morris says the micro was developed in response to robot manufacturers introducing highspeed delta robots On the other side of the spectrum the world was developed in response to a nonrobotic application says Morris It was a big gantry system where they were trying to move around half of an airplane and our strongest was nt quite up to it In addition to the flexibility tool changers provide and the safety aspects of reducing the frequency the operator has to enter the robot cell to change end effectors ATI s CEO says one of the primary benefits of tool changers is maintenance It s a time issue When we re talking about somebody changing out an end effector we re looking at maybe 20 minutes of work for somebody to get it off a robot and get another one back on A tool changer can do it in 3 to 6 seconds Then you have the other benefit which is quality Little continues When a robot is exchanging tools with a tool changer it s done quickly and accurately If it s done manually you have the potential properly That can create a malfunction later in the line This video shows one of ATI s tool changers in action exchanging packaging end effectors Intelligent Control Modules Part of making endofarm tooling more intelligent is allowing for better communication between the robot and the end effector and ultimately providing valuable feedback to the end user Intelligent control modules are bridging the gap between the robot controller the tool changer and the end effector modules Applied Robotics released the latest iteration of its SmartComm Control Module The system s designer Henry Loos describes how it works to the end user s advantage Not only does it allow our customer to change tooling without suffering any ill network and bus effects we can now look at the customer s devices on the endofarm tooling and report back to him with any issues about his EOAT even if it s not our end effector Our aim was to make this much easier for maintenance by doing some of that work for them unique in that it is designed to intrinsically handle many of the standard bus networks on the market without having to completely redesign the system especially if lastminute changes are made to the bus says Loos And it can talk to any robot controller The control module is designed to work with Applied s Sigma line of tool changers including its newly released Sigma NextGen tool changer shown in the photo Loos says it s the strongest tool changer in its class with driver design and cam geometry to provide increased moment and acceleration at high payloads up to 1500 kg It has a failsafe coupling mechanism We can lose nearly all of the air to the changer and still maintain our moment and load rating somewhere up to around 80 percent of total Loos adds It takes a little more time milliseconds to fully engage those cams into a coupled state but once we get there we re so much safer against loss of air high part variability tool changers may not always be practical That s where highly adaptable anthropomorphic end effectors are entering the work envelope Anthropomorphic and Adaptable Finger Grippers Largely confined to research labs until recently where their flexibility and versatility were sought after for testing disruptive robotics technologies a new breed of anthropomorphic grippers are increasingly strutting their digits on the factory floor They have grabbed the attention of human collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans in lessstructured environments and in small to midsized businesses where robotics is becoming more accessible Manufacturers are looking for reliable rugged flexible and reusable handling solutions says Guy Robert Director of Marketing at Robotiq in SaintNicolas Quebec Canada In past years manufacturers have seen tool changers as a solution But costs related to custom tooling design and changeovers made this solution not so attractive for many manufacturers who have to produce parts in low volume Manufacturers are also looking to automate applications where there is a high mix handle due to their shape or the material fragile brittle used to build them So having a flexible handling tool that can grip a wide variety of parts becomes very important It becomes even more important when manufacturers want to use this same tool for future production processes A relatively young company in the endofarm tooling arena Robotiq offers a line of flexible and adaptive industrial robot grippers with what Robert refers to as mechanical intelligence designed to handle a wide variety of part shapes sizes and composite materials The idea is that by using a single robot gripper the user saves on tooling costs and can improve process efficiencies Robotiq s electric servodriven 2finger and 3finger grippers enable the user to control grasping factors such as the openingclosing speed of the fingers force applied on the object being handled and precise control of the fingers to enable partial open and close for fast cycle times The adaptive 2finger grippers are designed for daytoday manufacturing where engineers want to automate typical cell has to handle 5 to 20 different parts and instead of using a tool changer with many different end effectors a single robot gripper represents time saved on changeovers and reduced tooling costs This video shows a variety of applications for Robotiq adaptable grippers including bin picking machine tending and flexible fixturing for welding The 3finger gripper is designed for advanced manufacturing and research According to Robotiq it combines the flexibility of anthropomorphic functionality with the reliability of manufacturing EOAT and reduces programming complexity while providing more gripping options In this video Robotiq 3finger grippers are used to perform 3D bin picking and assembly tasks They even wield traditional tools for some operations Another relative newcomer to the robotic EOAT stage is attracting attention with a magnetic personality Switchable Magnetic Technology A magnetic technology originally hailing from Down Under is creating buzz in the automation world Switchable permanent magnets emerged from a fiveyear strategic RampD program funded by the Australian government This patented technology uses opposing magnetic fields collapse the magnetic field Commercialization of the technology was launched by Magswitch Technology from its headquarters in Colorado where all Magswitch products were designed and tested most notably a new line of magnetic robot grippers like no other We re different because other end effectors on the market use high air pressure to rip a magnet away from the material which causes impact stress on the magnet and results in shorter service life says Michael Blanchard Engineering Manager at Magswitch Technology Inc in Westminster Colorado Unlike electromagnets Magswitch end effectors will remain in the on position if the system loses electric input or air Blanchard also notes that electromagnets require battery backup and expensive cabling that must be replaced every year Our magnets are much lighter stronger and easier to turn on and off than any other magnetic switches Our smallest tool weighs 02 lb and has a maximum holding force of 55 lbf Mechanical grippers are inherently heavy pieces of equipment on the order of three to five times a robot that is 20 to 35 percent smaller But they can go big too You may have seen Magswitch in action at IMTS in Chicago This video from the event shows a FANUC M2000iA robot benchpressing a 1200kg railway wheelset using 8 Magswitch magnets generating a combined gripping force of 24000 lbf The Magswitch automation line has five product areas The three primary gripper models include the MSeries which is a small single housing designed for flat surfaces The ARSeries grippers are designed for irregular shapes and come with removable customizable pole shoes which Blanchard says customers can cut to fit their particular part configuration Our circular array tool the AYSeries shown in the photo is a patented design that uses multiple magnets with different magnetic fields to create a very shallow depth of field to destack sheet material explains Blanchard We can land on a piece of material 07 mil thick and take one sheet off of the top of another It has a very very quickly and do nt necessarily have to be in balance In this video Magswitch grippers are used in an automotive manufacturing facility to sort and stage small door panel inner components for a subsequent welding process In the first phase of the process a delta robot is using vision guidance and a Magswitch AR gripper with extended pole shoes to pick sort and place different parts onto the appropriate conveyor channels Once on the conveyors the parts are picked by an articulating robot equipped with a highspeed rotary tool and Magswitch AR grippers each with particular poleshoe styles custom cut to fit each part configuration The robot then uses the rotary tool to nest the parts into the appropriate welding fixtures on a turntable Right now a small amount of air is required to turn the magnets on and off The largest consumable cost in most production lines is the generation of vacuum says Blanchard We reduce the consumption of air by around 90 percent Many factories are trying technology in 2015 ApplicationSpecific Grippers In order to differentiate themselves and meet demands of an everincreasing number of industries and applications implementing automation EOAT manufacturers are exploring specialized solutions for unique or extreme applications SAS Automation designed and developed specialized needle grippers used for removing muffins cupcakes and other baked goods from baking pans a process called depanning Designed for highvolume low maintenance depanning the SAS Muffin Depanner has custom stainless steel needle grippers each using 4 curved needles to depan 144 muffins from 2 moving baking pans on an oven conveyor SAS engineering manager says the smalldiameter needles leave limited evidence of penetration This application also involves hygienic design with stainless steels and foodgradetype polymers so that everything can be washed down and cleaned says Westbeld We ve also used this style of gripper to handle vinyl for automotive applications IPR Robotics customdesigned an endofarm tool for handling aluminum die cast automotive engine blocks The pneumaticdriven EOAT is twosided for loadingunloading the on one side The other side incorporates 3jaw grippers 4 in a row for loading sleeve inserts into the mold prior to casting the part The endofarm tool has to be very precise in order to properly insert the liner sleeves into the molds before loading the part says IPR s Peretz It also has to be robust to withstand extreme temperatures The tooling manufacturers that are going to continue to thrive says Schmitz are the ones that are adopting or embracing as many technologies as possible for gripping and combining them to come up with new solutions From dualduty grippers to intelligent communication modules the scope of endofarm tooling is reaching broader and aiming higher to make the entire robotic system more effective and efficient What in the world would compel a suspected criminal to return to the scene of the crime beyond a total lack of common sense In the case of one recent burglary after a thief realized who he or she had been stealing from an overwhelming sense of regret appeared to prompt a return of all of the victim s stolen goods A center that offers help to sexual assault victims suffered a huge blow after a thief broke into the California facility clipping wires to deactivate the alarm system and wreaking general havoc Our office is really secure said the woman who runs the facility We have the best locks But they still managed to find a way in Whoever broke in made off with a load of computer equipment and was long gone by the time the cops showed up The woman who runs it explains to the Governor s Office of Emergency Services that she overheard a police officer discussing what had happened with local He was explaining what our facility does and the services we provide to the community I left around 130 am she said A mere few hour later she got another call from the cops the burglar had come back toting all of the computers that had been stolen earlier that night The burglar left a note explaining the return of the items We had no idea what we were takeing sic Here your stuff back We hope you guys can continue to make a difference in peoples lives God Bless The woman who runs the center thinks that the transients spread the word about what kind of work happened at the facility somehow it got back to the burglar or burglars Mark Strong to play Lex Luthor in Man of Steel sequel MARK STRONG has fuelled reports suggesting he is set to portray Superman s arch nemesis Lex Luthor in the MAN OF STEEL sequel after refusing to confirm or deny the casting rumours PUBLISHED 0921 Tue Aug 13 2013 The Sherlock Holmes star was recently tipped to take on the role of the villain in director Zack Snyder s forthcoming film and Strong has done little to silence the claims When asked about the casting news by DigitalSpycom he coyly replied All I can say is watch this space If Strong does sign on he will follow in the footsteps of Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey who have both famously brought the character to life on film It s not the only casting mystery surrounding the Man of Steel sequel rumours have swirled about who will play Batman since Snyder confirmed that the Caped Crusader will feature in the followup at last month California Ryan Gosling Josh Brolin and Joe Manganiello have all been mentioned as possible contenders for the coveted role taking over from Christian Bale who stepped down following the completion of Christoper Nolan s Dark Knight trilogy Henry Cavill will reprise his role as Superman in the planned sequel Comments Unavailable

Industry body says Develop s findings back up the need for clarity among professions Creative Skillset is calling for games companies to agree to a consistent approach to research following findings by Develop which showed that its 2012 census of the creative industries presented an inaccurate picture of today s UK games workforce Skillset estimated that just 5500 people are working in the UK games industry today in its census which was published in early July As part of our research for the Develop 100 UK Studio Hot List we found that there are currently more than 500 game development studios alone operating in the UK That does not include outsourcing or services firms such as testing outfits sound specialists or CGI production houses that cater for the games sector of which there are many Both Creative Skillset s and TIGA s research showed an overall decline of the games sector Skillset said workforce the different surveys and this has led to differences in estimates of employment in the games sector So now the skills body is inviting games companies to join its employer panel to agree better consistency for classifying the games professionals and their various specialist segments Whereas TIGA s research has a specific focus on just the games industry Creative Skillset s Census covers multiple sectors which can make direct comparisons misleading In our research we have found some games companies classifying themselves as interactive media said Dr Kion Ahadi head of research and evaluation at Creative Skillset This is largely due to the change in games platforms from traditional consoles to tablets and smartphones These variations reinforce the problem in comparing data from different surveys and the importance of consistency across the industry Skillset said this variation in classification was evident in Develop s recently published UK Studio Hot List It points out that many of the companies in our game studios list would be classified within Skillset s Census as CEO Dr Jo Twist agreed It can be difficult to get a definitive picture and a complete dataset It is important that we all work together to agree on how we are classified and measured as a sector and we encourage every company to participate in research projects trying to address this such as Creative Skillset s industry panels the Develop 100 and Tiga s census The problem remains that there is no single industry agreed methodology on measurement which can lead to confusing and sometimes conflicting information We have been working on the DCMS classification codes to fix this as well as projects such as the digital download chart to understand the size value and nature of our sector Creative Skillset has been working on definitions research in partnership with UKIE NESTA Creative amp Cultural Skills and the Department for Culture Media and Sport to review the Standard Industrial Classification SIC and Standard Occupational Classification SOC codes that represent the wider Creative Industries which include the games important piece of research as the current classification and definition of the Creative Industries understates the value and scale of our industries It is only by accurately classifying which industries and occupations make up the sectors that we are able to measure the size of the workforce and the economic contribution of the industries to growth Skillset will present a report to the Office of National Statistics ONS later this year that recommends changes to the definitions to be adopted in the next round of ONS research due in 2017 and 2020 Skillset s industry panels will help influence strategy and these classifications for the games industy To find out more about the Creative Skillset Census

a driving range s netting Whoever it was must have been a hell of a golfer said Anne Mulholland 66 who was sitting at the stop in Croydon when the ball hit her She was left with a bruised chin and bleeding gums It came from nowhere and I did nt see it If I had seen it I would have ducked I am lucky it just hit my chin she said If it had hit my eyes or brain I could be dead now We are so paranoid to stand at that tram stop now because of what happened It could have been a child The World of Golf range backs on to the Arena stop with her sister Vera Stork 69 who she lives with and Jill Ebell 62 a cousin who was visiting from Australia Shortly after Mrs Mulholland was hit three other balls flew over the netting landing near the stop In reply to a letter of complaint from Ms Stork World of Golf chief executive Grant Wright said he was shocked and extremely sorry about the incident which happened at midday on Saturday July 27 and pledged that there would be a full investigation He wrote In the last six years since I have been chief executive we have never had a ball strike a member of the public During this period that equates to more than 150 million balls hit at our

tool Loki after the mythological Norse shapeshifting god Word of the federal hunt for a stealth snowmobile first surfaced two years ago when National Defence s research and development agency posted a public tender That 2011 tendering document however offered few details on the future of these missions except for the top priority silence The project kicked off at a time when the Conservative government was laying out promises to boost Canada s military muscle in the Far North in a oncevaunted package of Canadian Forces upgrades the feds have largely failed to implement Prime Minister Stephen Harper is scheduled to arrive in the Arctic on Sunday for a sixday tour of the region where his government s main focus has gradually moved from improving the country s northern military capabilities to promoting economic development The stealthsnowmobiles project has withstood that political shift National Defence has made money on Arctic mobility for eight years but its research branch says the evaluation of the silent snowmobile though still in its early stages will continue The Canadian Press obtained a report that offers a behindthescenes peek at how soldiers ran the prototype through informal tests in February across varying snow conditions on Canadian Forces Base Petawawa These experiments compared Loki against commercially available snowmobiles already in use testing a wide variety of the snowmobiles characteristics including speed towing capacity endurance mobility usability and of course noise emissions says the heavily redacted report acquired under the Access to Information Act In one test military personnel used soundmeter readings to compare the prototype s noise performance against two gaspowered snowmobiles Another trial saw the machine driven at a steady speed on a mix of flat terrain and hilly snowcovered roads until batteries died Soldiers wielding a radar gun also tested the stealth snowmobile s acceleration as it raced 100 metres down a flat at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile while providing a significant noise reduction the report said For military purposes it is not enough for a snowmobile to operate quietly The report also found potential gaps in the military s assessments One of the difficulties encountered in evaluating Loki is the lack of a standard set of CF snowmobile requirements the document said Large sections of the May report such as test results and comments were blacked out The document justified its omissions under different provisions of the Access to Information Act including one that says information is withheld because releasing it could be injurious to the defence of Canada or the detection prevention or suppression of subversive or hostile activities A government spokesman declined to make the report s author available for comment nor did he answer questions on why Canada s military wants the unconventional snow machine In general anything in the military that Paine a spokesman for Defence Research and Development Canada said Whether it flies or goes on the sea or anywhere else if it s quieter it s advantageous to any military Later in an email Paine said the testing and evaluations are ongoing He also said the Canadian Forces are looking at different small vehicles that can be modified to traverse all types of difficult terrain under various conditions This includes but is not limited to vehicles such as snowmobiles In the original federal tender Ottawa said it was seeking a snow machine that would run by gaspowered engine but would have the capability to easily switch to a silent mode electric motor The noise level of an internal combustion engine can not be reduced to an acceptable level for missions where covertness may be required especially given the increased propagation of sound in cold dry Arctic air read the tendering document which also indicated bids could s research agency was pursuing the development of a silent snowmobile for winter operations in Canada specifically in the Arctic The Canadian Press obtained the contract which listed the revised price tag at nearly 620000 The winning bid came from CrossChasm Technologies which is based in Waterloo Ont and also has an office in Montreal Simon Ouellette the firm s director of project development refused to discuss the stealth snowmobile due to a confidentiality agreement with National Defence One Arctic policy expert questioned whether the cost of developing such a vehicle is money wellspent particularly since he does nt believe there are any significant security threats in the Far North I do nt see a whole lot of evidence that criminals and terrorists are scooting around Canada s North on snowmobiles and that we have to sneak up on them said Michael Byers a former federal NDP candidate who teaches international law at the University of British Columbia Byers said he s not s actual needs Perhaps he added they have

France and all over the States Just the other day I two gentlemen from Mexico Ostiguy seemed surprised that so many people come to visit It s a very rustic shrine she said We ve got animals squirrels and bears you name it But somehow people like coming here It s very peaceful and quiet Around the Grotto where rows of pews looked on to a display of Mary birdcalls echoed through the woods It s a peaceful place to sit and say the rosary at night Ostiguy said A grassy trail leads through the forest nearby where the Stations of the Cross appear amidst the poplar trees We tell people to make noise when they walk through because of the bears see at the Shrine is a statue that was erected in 1885 by a man named Charles Nolin after his wife recovered from a serious illness According to the

Netherlands it has been announced that seven of the 11 have now opened Schools in the northern hemisphere start their school year around this time and these socalled Steve Jobs schools are now among them The seven pioneering locations are Sneek Breda Almere Emmen Heenvliet and Amsterdam In the schools the iPad will replace many traditional learning tools and elements such as blackboards schedules and parentteacher conferences Two of the schools currently provide the iPadcentric curriculum at all grade levels while the other schools will begin with younger students and expand to higher grades as the children move through school reports TUAWcom The schools also boast several other unique features such as the sCoolSpace which is a virtual schoolyard where the students can meet anytime Whether or not it will include a unclear at this stage One other feature that is bound to be hugely popular is the schools attitude to time pupils can attend any time between 730am and 630pm as long as they are definitely present between 1030 and 3pm The whole enterprise is an initiative of the Education for a New Era Foundation O4NT which developed the teaching principles behind schools Liberal HQ spy fears force Victorian press gallery hacks out Journos in Melbourne are spitting chips after they were told to shift from their spiritual home by Denis Napthine s mandarins It seems paranoid Liberal operatives thought they were being spied on Senior Victorian press gallery journalists are in uproar after they were forced out of their offices in the middle of the election campaign on the orders of Coalition powerbrokers moaning about leaks Until this week the press gallery and the Coalition s national campaign headquarters shared the same Melbourne building 35 Spring Street with the hacks on level 9 and the Libs and Nats on levels 1 and 2 The journalists have called the building home for at least a decade with the Tories moving in just six weeks ago Veteran gallery figures have told Crikey that an original plan to shift from the building controlled by the state Department of Premier and Cabinet was brought forward by six weeks when a faceless state government bureaucrat acting on instructions relayed clean out desks by today was fucking outrageous The idea that the Liberal Party can complain to Denis Napthine and just order Premier and Cabinet to shift us out in the middle of an election campaign when we were nt even going to have computers connected or we were nt even going to have the phone lines working is fucking absurd The principle being fuck off if you want a building do nt kick us out just because you want to shove the Libs in there Senior Liberals including campaign director Brian Loughnane Tony Nutt and John Griffin work out of Spring Street and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott calls the office home when he is in Melbourne Crikey understands the level 9 digs enabled hacks to keep tabs on Liberal and National MPs coming in and out of the building and that the pollies might ve felt like they were being spied on Such is the paranoia inside Coalition HQ that sources told Crikey this morning that the Australian Communications and Media Authority was drafted in Press gallery president and Australian political editor John Ferguson was hesitant to hold forth but confirmed to Crikey he was not happy with the order from on high I m not saying there s a political conspiracy but the shift has been monumentally rushed and difficult during an election campaign There are about 20 press gallery members remaining at 35 Spring and the remainder are lugging their equipment up the hill today to the new digs on the corner of Collins and Spring Gallery veterans told Crikey one of the other bonuses of 35 Spring was that you could look down on the 1 Treasury Place forecourt to see whether a minister was doing a sneaky presser and that the view was now obscured forever In 2011 The Age reported that 35 Spring was likely to be demolished to make way for a 42storey residential tower On a promotional page Cbus Property spruiks the planned Bates Smartdesigned development as the new gateway to the city and Melbourne s ultimate residential address One Fairfax and that one concession was televisions now worked where previously the Coalition s hulking bank of plasmas interfered with reception Napthine s media unit did not respond to a query lodged with his office this morning I had the misfortune of working in that building in 198889 A gloomier more decrepit beige blob is difficult to imagine It was nice if you had a view of the park I did But everyone else felt like extras out of Brazil Yes it was rude to evict the Journos But I have to think they ll be happier anywhere else That building is appalling I m glad it s being torn down Gallery veterans told Crikey one of the other bonuses of 35 Spring was that you could look down on the 1 Treasury Place forecourt to see whether a minister was doing a sneaky presser and that the view was now obscured forever What is this crap And WTF is a sneaky presser For God s sake Regardless of economic strength or level of development countries with substantial fossil fuel resources are almost certain to be heavy carbon polluters a phenomenon dubbed the carbon curse A study by Oxford University academics Joerg Friedrichs and Oliver Inderwildi published today in the journal Energy Policy suggests policy makers should turn to the fuelrich nations first to start reducing carbon emissions With more resources such as coal oil or gas to waste invariably such countries are the worst polluters While this may seem obvious on the surface the authors identify four mechanisms at work Extracting the resource is energy intensive oil drilling coal mining and often wasteful eg gas flaring Cheap plentiful fuel means a low incentive to invest in energy efficiency Governments are under pressure to offer uneconomic subsidies to citizens who expect to benefit from their nation s natural resource and cheap fuel crowds out demand for other forms of energy production such as renewables Each of these pushes the unit of GDP far higher than comparable countries that lack natural resources These perverse incentives almost guarantee that fuelrich countries will struggle to reduce carbon emissions whether they are developed or developing nations The 41 countries studied included OPEC petrostates like Saudi Arabia Venezuela Iraq and Nigeria developed economies including European nations the US South Korea South Africa and Australia and developing economic powerhouses like China India and Brazil In almost every case the fuel rich nations suffered the carbon curse with high emissions and high inefficiencies The only countries to buck the trend were Norway and the UK both fuel producing states that nevertheless achieved lower carbon emissions and energy efficiency Dr Friedrichs said the analysis offered an alternative way of approaching climate change discussions that moved away from the blame game played out between established and developing economies where each demands the other make emissions reductions Policy makers should be aware that the main division is not between advanced and emerging economies If you want to understand why a country has a high carbon intensity it will tell you more to look at resources than other economic indicators Put simply scarcity leads to responsible use of a resource abundance the opposite Even countries such as Germany among Europe s strongest advocate for renewables and emissions reduction faired poorly because it produces and uses large amounts of lignite a highly polluting brown coal Likewise Australia and Canada were brought down by their coal and tar sands industries Dr Dabo Guan senior lecturer in environmental economics and governance at Leeds University said that climate change discussions hinged on whether governments sought low carbon or merely lower carbon solutions For example as carbon intensity is expressed in relation to GDP it can be driven down by substantially increasing GDP rather than lowering overall emissions Of course in the course of manufacturing processing and selling more things to increase GDP carbon emissions would inevitably also rise substantially In climate negotiations India and China talk about relative lower carbon targets and relative indicators not absolute targets for low emissions China says by 2020 it will reduce carbon intensity by 45 but if the economy continues to grow and GDP increases more than emissions doing so is no problem Producing 40 of the world s steel 60 of concrete and around half of the world s metal processing China s unencumbered economy can produce considerable income and emissions The product of a huge amount of these emissions are in any case destined for the lesspolluting West Norway the UK the West we rely heavily on imported oil and gas from Africa Asia and the Middle East We have essentially outsourced our emissions to these countries Dr Guan said A further problem is that countries that have lowered carbon emissions to a certain level experience diminishing returns on the huge amount of money spent to lower them further Better instead globally speaking easier to implement measures have not yet been taken Unfortunately these are the states whose often corrupt or powerful controlling elites have the least incentive to do so or where wasteful practices such as gas flaring from oil wells are commonplace despite electricity black outs and fuel poverty among the people Dr Friedrichs suggests the answer is for petrostates to fund RampD in hightech nations so that the fruits of their combined cash and labour technologies like carbon capture and storage or supercritical steam generators for efficient power plants can be offered back to the developing world for everyone s benefit One of numerous thorny political questions in climate negotiations But while it is easier said than achieved the achievements of Norway and the UK show that it is possible with the right policies and determination to act for states to break the spell of fossil fuels and lift the carbon curse Related News At

were gearing up on Tuesday for a probable military strike against Syria that could happen within days as punishment for last week s chemical weapons attacks blamed on President Bashar alAssad s government By Khaled Yacoub Oweis and William Maclean Western powers have told the Syrian opposition to expect military action against Assad s forces soon according to sources who attended a meeting between envoys and the Syrian National Coalition in Istanbul Amid a quickening drumbeat of preparations US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said American forces in the region were ready to go if President Barack Obama gives the order as intelligence agencies assembled what is sure to be final confirmation of the Syrian government s culpability for Wednesday s poison gas attack near Damascus White House spokesman Jay Carney said it would fanciful to think that anyone other than Syrian President which killed hundreds of people as they slept Obama has yet to make a final decision on the US response Carney said but left little doubt that it would involve military action He insisted however that Washington was not intent on regime change signalling that any military strikes would be limited and not meant to topple Assad The British military was also drafting plans Prime Minister David Cameron anxious like Obama not to emulate the entanglements in wars in Afghanistan and Iraqi that beset their predecessors said any strikes would be specific so as not to drag the allies deeper into the Syrian civil war now in its third year Cameron recalled parliament for a debate on Syria on Thursday U N chemical weapons investigators put off until Wednesday a second trip to the rebelheld suburbs of Damascus where activists say hundreds of civilians died a week ago While evidence of chemical warfare could bolster an argument for intervention at the United Nations in leaders and the Arab League have already declared Assad guilty Ahmad Jarba president of the rebel Syrian National Coalition met envoys from 11 countries at an Istanbul hotel including the US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford The rebel leaders proposed targets for cruise missiles and bombing One participant said The opposition was told in clear terms that action to deter further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime could come as early as in the next few days Planning appears to focus on missile or air strikes There is little public support in Western countries for troops to invade Syria We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfil and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take Hagel said The precise timing of possible military action remained unclear but it is certain to wait for an official US intelligence report blaming Assad s government for the chemical attack The findings considered merely a formality at this point will be released pressure for US action on Syria Obama is expected to keep close watch on the situation there but he will go ahead with a speech on Wednesday at Washington s Lincoln Memorial marking the 50th anniversary of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr s I have a dream speech MOOD IN DAMASCUS Syria s government backed by Iran denies gassing its own people and has vowed to defend itself but residents of Damascus are growing anxious I ve always been a supporter of foreign intervention but now that it seems like a reality I ve been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed said a woman named Zaina who opposes Assad I m afraid of a military strike now The big fear is that they ll make the same mistakes they made in Libya and Iraq said Ziyad a man in his 50s They ll hit civilian targets and then they ll cry that it was by Russia Assad s main arms supplier opposes military action and has suggested that rebel forces may have released the poison gas China s state news agency recalled how flawed intelligence was used to justify the USled invasion of Iraq in 2003 Firm opposition from permanent members of the UN Security Council all but rules out a UN mandate of the kind that gave legal backing to NATO air strikes that helped Libyan rebels unseat Muammar Gaddafi two years ago However Western officials say they do want to act within international law Moscow and Beijing accuse Western powers of using human rights complaints such as in Libya to meddle in sovereign states affairs White House spokesman Carney insisted The options that we are considering are not about regime change They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons Although Obama has long said Assad should step down he is unwilling to commit to making that happen the interests of the United States to respond to the chemical weapons attack In Britain Cameron told reporters This is not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria or going further into that conflict It s about chemical weapons Their use is wrong and the world should nt stand idly by In France which played a major role in Libya President Francois Hollande said he was ready to punish Assad for using the chemical weapons citing a 2005 UN provision for international action to protect civilians from their own governments Similar arguments were used by NATO to bomb Serbia a Russian ally after the killing of civilians in Kosovo In an indication of support from Arab states that may help Western powers argue the case for an attack against likely UN vetoes from Moscow and Beijing the Arab League issued a statement holding Assad s government responsible for the chemical attack Fears of another international conflict in a sixmonth high and stocks fell around the world notably in Turkey as well as in emerging economies that would suffer from a chill in trade The government of Turkey a NATO member called for action against Assad for what it called a crime against humanity TOUGH CHOICES Obama Cameron and Hollande face questions at home about how a military intervention would end whether they risk bolstering Assad if he rides out the assault and whether they risk handing power to antiWestern Islamist rebels if Assad were overthrown Turmoil in Egypt where the 2011 uprising inspired Syrians to rebel has underlined the unpredictability of revolutions The presence of Islamist militants including allies of al Qaeda in the Syrian rebel ranks has given Western leaders pause They have held back so far from helping Assad s opponents to victory Syrian Foreign Minister Walid alMoualem said US strikes would help al Qaeda and called Western leaders delusional if they hoped to help the rebels reach a balance of defending ourselves and we will surprise them with these if necessary he said We will defend ourselves We will not hesitate to use any means available Assad s forces made little or no response to three attacks by Israeli aircraft earlier this year that Israeli officials said disrupted arms flowing from Iran to Lebanon s Hezbollah The presence of United Nations experts in Damascus may be a factor holding back international military action The experts came under fire in governmentheld territory on Monday before reaching the rebel lines They interviewed and took samples from survivors though much evidence may have decayed Opposition activists have said at least 500 people and possibly twice that many were killed by rockets carrying the nerve gas sarin or something similar If so it was the worst chemical weapons attack since Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Iraqi Kurds in 1988 DM Photo The

secular country and the allowance went against constitutional provisions ensuring equality of religion the public interest and would cost the exchequer Rs 126 crore annually Mr Sarkar s counsel Kaushik Chanda said Opposing the petition the counsels for the state government claimed it could lawfully extend the allowance and added that the Assembly had okayed the expenditure Refusing to accept

the 24hour Dilkush petrol bunk at Nadakkavu here Balakrishnan M fuel attendant is getting ready to spend a lonely Sunday night at the pump with just his mobile phone for company The bunk one of the three which operate round the clock in the city usually sees busy nights with trucks cars loaded with people halfasleep and school buses rolling in to fill their tanks But if the Petroleum Ministry has its way all this will come to a stop I heard that the Ministry wants to stop 24hour petrol pumps in cities to save petrol Have they already started doing it Mr Balakrishnan says stopping in his tracks while rushing between vehicles waiting to fill up Proposal The Ministry has mooted a proposal to stop the functioning of 24hour petrol bunks in cities between 8 pm and 8 am as an austerity measure to check the fall of the rupee and to lessen This is nothing short of nonsense Instead of controlling the fuel prices the government comes up with such ideas If you need fuel how will the timing of when you get your fuel curb the demand Use not to come down This measure if it becomes a reality will not stop people from using petrol It will only cause inconvenience Mohammed Riyaz a businessman who just zipped into the bunk in his SUV says Consumers say that changing bunk timings will result in practical inconveniences especially in Tier3 cities where the roads are narrow and traffic is heavy during peak hours Petrol bunk employees say that at nights most of their customers are people travelling long distances school buses trucks and even ambulances Changing the time will only result in long queues Financial discipline can not be attained by regulating bunk timings Besides such contrived means of regulation will lead to fuel hoarding and blackmarketing This kind of curfew on fuel in Tier3 cities where there are only a few 24hour bunks PTS Unni president Calicut Chamber of Commerce says Not everybody keeps their fuel tanks full if there is a personal emergency at home this socalled austerity measure may prove fatal Valsala Narayanan a retired teacher says this is a crazy act to stop 24 hrs pump there are people who work in night and travelers moving in night may require petrol to travel in night in that case it is necessity for them if you cut the working time of petrol pump then are you sure the economy will come up no stop all this curfew band harthal

2013 While still several years from being operational the launch of the carrier which has been designed to carry 36 fixed wing fighter aircrafts comprising a mix of MiG29K and the indigenous LCA naval variants in addition to Ka31 AEW and ALH helicopters will provide air cover to Indian Navy IN vessels The launching of the hull of INS Vikrant with the power plant and generators integrated is the first step in the further development of the ship particularly the weapon systems This work is likely to consume the better part of two years before the ship can join the operational fleet Only the UK the US France and Russia have demonstrated the ability to design and build such ships Reportedly the second Indigenous Aircraft Carrier IAC2 is under design already One particular feature of the aircraft carrier is like the US super carriers for the launch of the fixed wing aircraft Instead the bow of the ship sports a skijump configuration in which the aircraft rolling down the very short available runway on take off is lofted into the air like a skier1 This will impose limitations on the type of aircraft operable The IAC2 is likely to have catapults for aircraft launch The importance of air power at sea can not be overstated especially since the Battle of Coral Sea May 4 8 1942 in which two opposing fleets fought a major sea battle through the use of aircrafts launched from their carriers Replacement of the battleship of yore with aircraft carriers as the new capital ship has been a strategic choice for the navies of the world since then INS Viraat currently the sole Indian aircraft carrier operates Britishmade Sea Harrier2 fighters in addition to helicopters of various types INS Vikrant s MiG29K fighters are modern fourth generation fighters that will provide the IN with stateoftheart air BVR as well as Within Visual Range WVR missiles backed by advanced airborne radar and Infrared search and Track IRST systems and excellent agility The MiG29K also has an antiship and antiland target strike capability which would help in vastly increasing the reach safety and lethality of the fleets at sea The IN has fielded an aircraft carrier since 19613 The original INS Vikrant served from 1961 to 19974 Aspiring to field at least two carrier battle groups CBGs one each for the western and eastern seaboards the IN negotiated for induction of the erstwhile Soviet carrier the deactivated Admiral Gorshkov while also commencing to design an indigenous aircraft carrier The contract for its transfer of Admiral Gorshkov involved extensive refurbishment by Russia The refurbishment has faced extensive delays and cost escalations though the vessel is reportedly now nearing readiness The progress in the development of INS Vikrant indicates that India s shipbuilding capabilities are maturing towards selfreliance in design and development of highend naval vessels At the nuclear powered submarine are complex By 2020 INS Vikrant should be ready for operational deployment and could be reasonably be expected to be joined in a few years by its sister ships that may include further refinements over the original design Both INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant are expected to carry MiG29K fighters sourced from Russia to be joined later by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited s HAL s Tejas naval variant By the 2030s the IN should be able to field three CBGs giving it the capability to protect India s interests at locations far removed from the coast The increasingly designed and made in India nature of the IN s fleets should provide strategic and tactical flexibility through total ownership of critical technologies and capabilities Air power afloat as an integral part of the Indian naval fleets should provide these vessels assured air defence and fire power against surface targets at sea and on land The IN has long aspired for a true blue water capability and the aircraft carrier project is a in the project from the design stage onwards at the Cochin shipyard thus giving it total ownership Also the time and cost overruns in the indigenous aircraft carrier project are relatively minor The Admiral Gorshkov s refurbishment by Russian shipyards

process India has major maritime interests These arise from the fact that most of India s foreign trade is carried by sea India s energy imports also come by sea Therefore it is important for the country to be able to provide security along these sea lanes of communication SLsOC Moreover with an expanding economy India requires to be able to access raw materials sourced from other countries along the Indian Ocean rim as well as further away Thus India must be able to freely access the SLsOC to these regions The Indian Ocean hosts some and the Straits of Malacca In international waters it is critical to have capabilities to protect national assets particularly the sea passage choke points Naval fleets have the ability to stay on station for long and carry considerable integral firepower An aircraft carrier bolsters the potency of naval fleets by deploying fighter aircrafts that can apply long distance power from their carrier Carriers can provide intelligence reconnaissance and other essential support functions as well A carrier battle group thus enhances the power projection capability of its fleet manifold The INS Vikrant signifies the coming of age of India s ability to design and build major warships in the country and much to cheer for the indigenous defence industry Moreover it indicates that the IN is close to achieving capabilities to field forces at long distances in order to safeguard India s maritime interests Views expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the IDSA or of the Government of India 1 The upwards momentum imparted to the aircraft as very short available runway and therefore suboptimal achieved speed due to the short take off run The short take off run would result in lower speed than required for take off However the ski jump lofts the aircraft upwards the additional height so gained allows the aircraft to build up adequate speed for a safe climb out 2 The Sea Harrier is an excellent aircraft with vertical landing and take off capability However its unique design restricts its radius of action especially in vertical take off mode Moreover it was designed in the late 1950s and 1960s Hence its design has imitations in performance compared with modern fighters of later design 3 India bought the underconstruction HMS Herculese Majestic class aircraft carrier from UK in 1957 Upon its completion in 1961 it was commissioned into the IN as INS Vikrant 4 INS Vikrant which had commenced being built in 1943 and was finally completed in 1961 came to be decommissioned in 1997 IN bought INS Viraat to replace the first INS Vikrant The Viraat also boasts a ski jump configuration and came equipped to operate the Sea Harrier fighters in addition to helicopters 5 Initially the Admiral

6 2013 0631 PM IST VISAKHAPATNAM Official work in the state has come to a grinding halt dashing the hopes of more than four lakh security personnel in about 1500 private security agencies across the state looking for better employment prospects According to sources private security personnel outnumber the police force in a ratio of 31 and provide services in various sectors including industries educational institutions commercial establishments banking sector and residential complexes According to Andhra Pradesh Private Security Association APPSA members nearly 200 applications are pending with the home department for issuance of licences and nearly 30 of them have undergone necessary verification but are still awaiting approval as the government has gone slow following the recent developments related to the bifurcation of the state APPSA president C Bhaskar Reddy said The government has totally stopped issuing licences Union Territory then security agencies will have to take three licences one each from Andhra Pradesh Hyderabad and Telangana According to managing director of Haikor Security Agencies K S Rao Some of the private security agencies had even undergone training at AP Police Academy in Hyderabad but are yet to get the government nod While the Private Security Agency Regulation Act 2005 was passed by Parliament the state assembly enacted the AP Private Security Agency Regulation Rules in 2008 following which private security agencies have to obtain licences from the AP special secretary home who is the controlling authority for dealing with private security agencies and issuing licences However sources say that the stakeholders were not consulted when the regulations were passed leading to a plethora of problems for security agencies There were some modifications and changes that were needed and APPSA had regularly met with government authorities and we were awaiting necessary changes in the rules he said explaining that verification of credentials of the private security personnel and the owners With the Telangana issue surfacing the amendments were put on hold sources said If the government fails to make the necessary amendments nobody will follow the strict training required for security guards Bhaskar Reddy said While the demand for security personnel is witnessing a consistent 20 growth over the last few years Rao said that guards are still treated as unskilled labour even though they are operating the latest gadgets are involved in monitoring security including handling of CCTVs and taking care of documentation related to movement of goods in industries The amendments will lead to better training and increase selfrespect among security personnel The image of industry will improve as a professional force This will bring better integration with the home department and the huge force can be gainfully utilised for intelligence gathering and miscellaneous duties Rao said Representative of APPSA at Vizag UCH Bhupal Verma said Once the amendments are made standards will be maintained and we will also be able to assist the police department whenever the need arises RELATED From around the web More from The

lows against the dollar it appears to be a great time for nonresident Indians NRIs to remit funds to India for investment And for most NRIs the preferred asset class continues to be real estate But with the India story looking a little bleak is property a good investment right now The answer is yes provided you are patient and cautious There has been price correction in India to a certain extent and developers are sitting on huge inventory However I estimate that the entire correction will take up to 2 years So NRIs must be particular in their investments and pick and choose after due research says Pankaj Kapoor founder and managing director at Liases Foras Real Estate Rating amp Research Pvt Ltd So if you are ready to take that challenging road here are a few tips to price points In the last few months we have witnessed good closures specifically emerging from NRIs in cities where value deals are available namely cities like Bangalore Hyderabad Chennai and Pune Demand in the midincome and budget segments is robust across cities where job creation is the key driver In light of the rupee s depreciation we are confident that the ITITeS sector will generate further job creation and strengthen the confidence of employees from this sector who are aspiring to buy first or second homes says Om Ahuja CEO Residential Services Jones Lang LaSalle India Kapoor adds In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and the National Capital Region the secondary market is appearing very attractive Investors are exiting these markets and in the past 15 days prices have corrected up to 25 in some of the cities So this might be a good time to pick up investor s stock Apart from these two key regions properties in cities like Hyderabad and Kochi are undervalued and it According to Ahuja the segment where good demand is being witnessed is in the price range of Rs 60 lakh to Rs 15 crore Investment time horizon and returns Here is where investors need to be patient I think the price correction is going to go on for another 2 years Kapoor explains which means investors should expect their asset value to remain more or less flat over the next two years Ahuja expects potential returns from current levels to be 1020 annualized returns over 68 years in Bangalore Chennai Pune Gurgaon and Navi Mumbai and 2030 in Hyderabad Tips to buy the right property Buying property in a market like this can be quite challenging So here are some parameters that you should look at Rental yield Rental yield is nothing but the annual rent divided by the property value Often buyers tend to ignore rental yield and instead focus only on capital appreciation However rental yield is a When you buy a property make sure that you can get a rental yield of at least 354 An yield of less than that means the property is overvalued Kapoor explains Months of inventory Months of inventory is specific to a particular project and is the amount of time the developer takes to sell all available units at the current price An efficient market maintains 810 months of inventory A longer time means that units are not selling at current price and a price correction may happen Today Mumbai and NCR carry 44 months of inventory on an average while Bangalore carries 12 months So this is another aspect you can check to see how inventory is moving says Kapoor Location Right now a lot of investors are exiting the market so NRIs might find many investor held property up for sale However a lot of these investor properties may be in uninhabited markets where the investor may have purchased the property thinking that the area would need to be wary of such locations Kapoor explains Developer track record Developers track record in terms of delivery and quality must be verified before investing Ensure that all approvals in place Attractive advertisements with celebrity endorsements and futuristic promises should not be the only factor for shortlisting the project for investment NRIs very often get carried away with good sales pitches and socalled premium projects NRIs should also be very cautious when it comes to investing with developers who are over leveraged and carry risk of project not getting completed on time Ahuja cautions Infact Kapoor suggests that now may not be a good time to opt for launch properties Instead opting for secondary properties might be a good option at this point Buying secondary properties has its own advantages Apart from being well priced there is no execution risk as the property is already completed Further there is no service tax so NRIs can save on that as well he says buying opportunities in the current market experts suggest that NRIs tread with caution Do nt jump on deals but do a thorough research before investing Stay

Peng at the time working for another company designing his own unique grinding media decided it was time to go it alone and set up his own business It was this calculated determination that led the creation of Sino Grinding In the early days of the business explains Pieter Theunissen Marketing Manager for Africa it specialised in the design of grinding media for use in SAG mills It was this somewhat niche market that Paul identified as being one that was often missed entirely by the larger grinding ball manufacturers What he subsequently did was design SAG mill grinding balls that could withstand high levels of impact and possessed good abrasion resistance Upon testing these balls were found to be highly successful and it was from here that the business would go from strength to strength in the years that followed Today the Sino Grinding level providing its clients with regular onsite technical support while proactively carrying out advanced research and development in order to bring new products to market to deal with specific problems The group itself is made up of several companies subsidiaries and representatives including Sino Grinding Industries Sino Grinding International Beijing Sino Grinding International and Sino Grinding Americas Inc Since its formation Sino Grinding s aims when it comes to the work it does for its clients have centred on four main focus areas those being the said clients steel consumption levels the costs expended per quantity of ore milled achieving grind by particle distribution improvements and increasing throughput levels From day one states Mark Addison General Manager of Sino Grinding Americas Inc we work continuously and tirelessly with our clients until we know that we have the right solutions to meet their requirements We are not milling specialists who provide a general purpose product to the whole industry rather we are specialist specifications set by our customers What makes such a unique approach possible is Sino Grinding s impressive range of seven different types and grades of forged SAG grinding media This far outnumbers the industry average which tends to see commercial grinding ball manufacturers producing no more than two types of media Sino Grinding s grinding media range in size from 05 13mm up to 65 165mm and cover all different kinds of mill type What our range of products allows us to do is match the environment that a customer is milling in to a particular solution Addison continues Further to this we provide technical services that including modelling the milling operations of our customers to improve the whole process choosing the correct grinding ball sizes and carrying out the initial ball charge calculation for the commissioning of new mills One recent and particularly impressive example of how Sino Grinding is able to improve the grinding activities of its customers can be found in Zambia at First assisted in halving the operation s consumption rates of mining media in kilograms per tonne thus helping it to make considerable cost savings over an extended period of time With such successful examples already visible within the marketplace Sino Grinding is currently working to build upon this by conducting tests with a wide range of companies and mining operators throughout the world where the said industry figures have a firsthand opportunity to compare the products they currently use with those of Sino Grinding During these tests Addison highlights one of the first things we work towards is being able to provide a recommendation of what the best size of grinding ball product would be for a particular potential customer then the selection of the Sino wide range of media grades begins This is our starting point from which we can begin to modify said recommendation throughout the course of discussions with the customer Time and again we have found this to be the best way of achieving the targets and aims that we are set boasts is the fact that it uses a specially designed multihammer forging process Much as has been the case with the chemical composition of the company s grinding ball range attempts have been made by competitors to replicate this process however no one has yet managed to get all the components right We take huge pride in the fact that we are not copiers rather we are innovative designers Theunissen enthuses Because of this we have managed to stay ahead of the curve and we estimate that we are still some years ahead of our nearest rivals when it comes to research and development While Sino Grinding has always been committed to developing new products and solutions the same ca nt necessarily be said about the vast majority of its competitors and this has resulted in an industry sector that overall has seen very little in the way of change for the last two decades This however is something that the company expects to change in the nottoodistant future Eventually the market as Addison concludes This will happen slowly and while it does it is our own aim to be recognised as the gotoguys when it comes to SAG milling and grinding ball solutions Our wide product range unique customer focused approach and dedication to quality has put us ahead of the game and that is where we intend to stay Content you might like An indepth look at the history and

Cross We said well you ve been eating food with ICRC red crosses on without caring very much Now the Red Crescent can supply even insurgentheld Raqaa with supplies but not the centre of Aleppo city which has been besieged for a month Days of negotiations between government and rebel forces precede most body extractions They usually come out within two to three days The rebels usually know the names of the soldiers they ve killed The deal is done between them on the front lines They use us as mediators to cross the front lines and get corpses out When they make the deal we get in touch with both sides to make sure it s Usually we put them in body bags The bodies are sometimes left in the place where they were killed most of them shot but last time in Deraya a suburb of Damascus they the rebels just pulled them from the place where they died to a house nearby where they gave them to us The last two Red Crescent volunteers to be killed were in Homs two months ago when a mortar shell fell outside the local Red Crescent office The war came to them Khaled Erksoussi speaks with great care about some elements of the Red Crescent s work I can well see why More than 15 volunteers remain imprisoned by the regime The problem of what is lawful and unlawful in war has been a major problem The government still regards the finding of a makeshift hospital as a victory since it has usually been set up to help wounded insurgents who can not go to a government hospital but this contradicts the fact that Mr Erksoussi believes that the fighting around Damascus has become more ferocious but you ca nt win with force this idea is on both sides now What s preventing both of them from stopping is ego It s not like they re equal When a government thinks it is fighting terrorists or evil you still have to be responsible for civilians But unless you close the tap weapons and money it will continue forever I ca nt say this place is going to hell because it s already there Weapons data is

dream of Melbourne Cup glory is very much alive Michael Owen s dream of having a runner in the Emirates Melbourne Cup in on Nov 5 is very much alive despite his gritty stayer Brown Panther finishing only fifth in Wednesday s Greene King Foundation Stakes over an inadequate mileandaquarter trip at Goodwood And so serious is the exfootball star at getting involved in Australia s showcase race he is sending Brown Panther s jockey Richard Kingscote to the important Turnbull Stakes meeting at Flemington on Oct 5 in an attempt to get firsthand experience of the track Trainer Tom Dascombe said I m happy enough with that run You ca nt really complain when you run in a race you never planned for in the first place He d had a setback before the Irish St Leger and we had to run here to make sure he was all right Brown Panther is around 201 for the Melbourne Cup but as far as Dascombe is concerned His setback was nothing serious but it was enough to knock us off stride He ran a temperature and was off his grub for 24 hours He missed a couple of days and you ca nt go for a big race in those circumstances But he s done well enough with this final run before going into quarantine Richard has probably gone a bit too quick out in front and we were trying to give 5lb to the winner so all things considered I was happy He ll go into quarantine here for two weeks and then fly down to Melbourne all going well As for Kingscote going on an early reconnaissance mission to Australia Dascombe said It would be very useful if Richard could get rides at Flemington in early October It is hard enough turning up to ride in the biggest race of your career without any previous experience of the track One of our owners has contacts in Melbourne so we as well Richard knows the horse he now has to learn what he can about the course he added Brown Panther first emerged as a likely prospect for Melbourne when winning the Goodwood Cup in August in which the homebred gave Owen his biggest success as an owner He bred the fiveyearold out of his mare Treble Heights a Group winner trained for him by John Gosden The winner Grandeur is a smart performer in his own right and was getting his season back on track with this convincing success under Ryan Moore He put a disappointing effort in the Arlington Million last time behind him with this victory and trainer Jeremy Noseda has some ambitious targets for the autumn including the Breeders Cup at Santa Anita in early November I was very worried about the ground today but I wanted to get another run into him before he goes off to America again said Noseda He has a few options out there and I will have to speak Anita but there are horses like The Fugue going there so we ll have to see It will depend if we decide to be brave The Mark Johnstontrained Double Bluff looks to have a bright future after running out a convincing winner of the nine furlong twoyearold maiden Sherlock The adventure of the expanding fandom The wait is on Picture PBSHartswood Films for the BBC Colin Hutton Sherlock was a show that originally slipped quietly under everybody s radar whilst being made It s probable the cast and crew look fondly back on the pilot episode 2009 and the entire first series that followed in 2010 for the simple reason that they were created in relative anonymity free of any pressure or expectations While both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman already had loyal fan bases after the first airing of Sherlock in late July 2010 it s fair to say that they both suddenly became far more visible in the public s eye By the time production rolled around on series two the first series had been sold to many overseas territories and the international fan base of the show had truly been established Sherlockology came into existence a week before series two began filming in May 2011 and enthusiastically followed as to visit the location of Faker Street AKA North Gower Street in North London while filming was underway By that point it was clear to the production team that they d created something special attracting a lot of attention from a dedicated group of onlookers from the pavement opposite Yet even then the crowds were manageable and we were stood with almost nobody around us at times and were struck by the oddity of seeing an actor disappear and a character you ve seen on television appear before your very eyes Sherlock has evolved into a show laden with massive expectation Cut to April 2013 nearly two years later and fans are lined sixdeep on the pavement Orange safety barriers pin them in away from the moving traffic in the road while the crew stop to take pictures of the assembled crowd Sherlock s producer Sue Vertue also requested that fans not post photos that may reveal major spoilers online via a message on our website We technically in another street stood on a step looking diagonally at the front door that is dressed as that of 221B A black Jag with tinted windows rolls around the corner and pauses outside the door Out steps Benedict Cumberbatch in full costume as Sherlock Holmes Cue the thunderous titanic screams With a visible smile on his face he waves to the mass of fans that have come to see him transform into the Great Detective It s fair to say that in these last three years everything has changed Not just for Benedict or Martin who has of course not just gone from Tim from the Office to John Watson but also Bilbo Baggins but the entire process of producing the series itself has changed Sherlock has evolved into a show laden with massive expectation With THAT ingenious series two cliffhanger festering in the minds of the now gigantic worldwide fan base it s been almost two years the best thing is that it s very nearly back Metro Blogs

auctioned in the Swiss city of Geneva at a record asking price of 60m 38m Sotheby s auction house says It says the ovalcut stone the Pink Star will become the most valuable diamond ever to be offered at auction This 5960 carat stone is simply off any scaleDavid Bennett Sotheby s chairman Europe amp Middle East Sotheby s David Bennett says the diamond belongs in the ranks of the earth s greatest natural treasures It is over twice the size of the 2478carat Graff Pink diamond that set the world auction record for 462m The gem which was mined by De Beers in Africa in 1999 has received the highest possible colour and clarity rating from the Gemological Institute of America GIA It weighed 1325 carats in the rough and was cut and polished over a Yorkbased auction house said in a statement on Wednesday I have had the privilege of examining some of the greatest gemstones in the world over the past 35 years and I can say without hesitation that the Pink Star diamond is of immense importance said Mr Bennett chairman of Sotheby s jewellery division in Europe and the Middle East He said it was very rare to have vivid pink diamonds weighing only five carats so this 596carat stone is simply off any scale The diamond which was previously known as the Steinmetz Pink was sold privately in 2007 but neither the price nor the owner was disclosed The auction is scheduled to take place on 13 November Sotheby s will also auction a white diamond and a blue diamond valued at more than 28m and 19m respectively in Hong Kong in October Capital One Cup Stoke City capable of reaching final says Mark Hughes Stoke City managed by Mark Hughes take on Crystal Palace at the Britannia Stadium Stoke boss Mark Hughes has no doubt his side have it in them to go all the way to the Capital One Cup final this season As a player Hughes won the League Cup on three occasions one time each at Manchester United Chelsea and Blackburn And as a manager he got both Rovers and Manchester City to the semifinals although in the latter case he lost his job before the lastfour tie took place The Welshman has been in charge of the Potters since the summer and is feeling optimistic about his chances of more success in the competition this term Speaking ahead of the third round trip to Sky Bet League One outfit Tranmere Hughes told Stoke Player It is a good competition for me it has been as a player and I ve done okay as a manager It would be nice this year to go one step further if we can and it is certainly within our capabilities A lot of Premier League sides are playing each other in this round so that will take a number of teams out of the equation So if we can get through this round then hopefully we can keep on progressing Stoke have made a fairly encouraging start to the season taking seven points from their opening five topflight fixtures as well as seeing off Walsall another third tier team 31 at home in the Capital One Cup second round They have also earned praise for what has been regarded as an improved playing style compared to their seasons under previous manager Tony Pulis Hughes feels things are going well but has stressed his Potters side are still very much a work in progress And with that in mind he does not view the fact the Staffordshire outfit have to play the Tranmere tie just three days after their all The more games we can play the better for the group in terms of what we are trying to do Hughes said At this point in the season we are still very much a work in progress so games will help us We will get better as we play more often together I feel we have taken huge strides in a small space of time but we need to keep the performance levels going in the right direction Hughes who made eight changes to his first XI for the Walsall game will reshuffle his pack Goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen will definitely come in for the rested Asmir Begovic while Erik Pieters will sit the contest out having picked up a calf problem that is not expected to

vetting deals that do nt require approval under the nation s foreigntakeover law according to two people who have advised on transactions involving stateowned companies Even foreign investors not usually deemed state owned are being asked to prove they are nt controlled or influenced by government including whether the state has the power to appoint directors said another person familiar with the process The people asked not to be identified as the details are nt public The federal government is also probing more proposed acquisitions involving stateowned firms to see if they pose a threat to national security said Julie Soloway a partner at Blake Cassels amp Graydon LLP in Toronto They are definitely digging deeper on these Sept 12 Mergers and acquisitions in the oil sands fell this year to the lowest since 2004 data compiled by Bloomberg show Smaller developers including Athabasca Oil Corp and BlackPearl Resources Inc are lagging behind peers after the government introduced rules to block stateowned buyers from purchasing oilsands companies Athabasca fell 24 percent since the rules were made public on Dec 7 versus a 64 gain on the Standard amp PoorsTSX Energy Index Additional Challenge You ve had companies that have taken a step back and looked at what they can do and what they ca nt do and I think a few transactions that were going to proceed have not proceeded because of this said George Gosbee chief executive officer of AltaCorp Capital Inc a Calgarybased investment bank The additional government scrutiny adds to challenges affecting Canadian energy stocks including a slower economy in China and pipeline shortages that have helped push Canadian heavy crude prices to US3120 a barrel below the US benchmark Spot prices for Western Canadian Select versus US10232 for West Texas Intermediate according to figures compiled by Bloomberg Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is examining whether the added scrutiny is contributing to a drop in investment by stateowned companies in a sector that depends on foreign cash Jim Prentice vice chairman of the bank and a former Canadian industry minister said in Calgary Energy Superpower It behooves us to look at this and to assess what the causes are and to make sure that as a country we re careful Prentice said in an interview on Sept 18 Prime Minister Stephen Harper who has called Canada an emerging energy superpower is asserting control over the nation s resources after about US51billion in investments by stateowned firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry over the last seven years according to data compiled by Bloomberg The nation s oil sands in Alberta are the world s third largest source of crude reserves and the starting point for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to CNOOC Ltd s US151billion acquisition of Calgary producer Nexen Inc and the 52billion purchase of Progress Energy Resources Corp by Petroliam Nasional Bhd Malaysia s stateowned energy company At the same time Harper said the government would permit further purchases of oilsands businesses by stateowned enterprises only under exceptional circumstances The government which already vets foreign takeovers above 344million also said it will carefully monitor deals involving stateowned enterprises in the world s 11thlargest economy and will act to safeguard Canadian interests when it appears that such acquisitions will undermine the private sector orientation of an industry The rules created a perfect storm to reduce deal activity in the oil sands where stocks had already been dragged down by lower oil and gas prices said Dan Cheng of Matco Financial Inc who helps manage 430million from Calgary Canadian energy companies have underperformed US peers by 27 percentage points on Standard amp Poor s indexes during the past five years according to figures US53billion Keystone XL pipeline is in its sixth year of US review a delay that has led to pipeline bottlenecks Economic growth in China the world s largest energy consumer is projected by analysts to rise 76 in 2013 the lowest annual increase since a 76 expansion in 1999 data compiled by Bloomberg show Voting Rights Now Industry Canada is reviewing transactions involving stateowned enterprises that fall below the 344million threshold that triggers an automatic review according to two people familiar with discussions with the department All foreign investors are also now being asked a set of questions on state control including whether a state owns a third or more of the investor s voting rights and whether a government has the power to appoint managers and members of the company s board said one of the people familiar with the talks Industry Minister James Moore said foreign takeovers have been elevated to a new degree of sensitivity since the Nexen and Progress decisions This is something that has greater sure that any decision is given the weight and consideration that it s due and the department is allocating the resources and talent to these kinds of decisions Moore said in an interview last month at his Ottawa office Pipeline Venture TransCanada and a unit of PetroChina Co said in October they would work together on a 3billion oil pipeline through Alberta After Harper announced the new foreigntakeover rules in December the government asked the companies to halt the project while it examined the deal on national security grounds said a person familiar with the issue The review surprised company officials because the government initially welcomed the project said the person who asked not to be identified because the discussions are nt public The project did nt involve oilsands production and was a joint venture not a takeover The pipeline is still on schedule said Davis Sheremata a TransCanada spokesman declining to comment on discussions with governments Mao Zefeng a spokesman in Beijing for PetroChina the publicly traded phone the company has no comment on the project Athabasca BlackPearl Industry Canada s media relations office did nt immediately respond to a request for comment on the department s scrutiny of transactions involving stateowned enterprises including the deal between TransCanada and PetroChina The 751million purchase by Exxon Mobil Corp and Imperial Oil Ltd of ConocoPhillips Clyden property in Alberta marked the first significant oilsands transaction in 2013 according to a report this month by Peters amp Co a Calgary investment adviser The deal activity compares with 161billion in mergers and acquisitions involving the oil sands last year including the Nexen takeover Investors betting on an Athabasca Oil takeover have left the stock Andre De Leebeeck a company spokesman said in a phone interview BlackPearl has had similar share price declines to Athabasca falling 35 since the rules were announced John Festival chief executive officer of the company did nt return a phone message seeking comment Seeking Clarity Athabasca which did has been seeking clarity for months on how the government defines control by a stateowned company to speed talks on potential new partnerships De Leebeeck said Canada s new foreigntakeover policies were more stringent than expected and have resulted in lower investment from state owned companies even outside the oil sands said John Brussa vice chairman at Burnet Duckworth amp Palmer LLP in Calgary That policy came a bit out of left field Brussa said It s made the SOEs quite reticent to stick their toe in the water generally he said referring to stateowned enterprises Westwood Square is one of a handful of Canadian projects where ownerdevelopers are rethinking the traditional shopping mall formula Fieldgate and Plazacorp The developers of Westwood

Louis CK and his Louie coexecutive producer Blair Breard who said that Louie season 4 went into production this week with the goal of returning to FX next May The 300TOOLONG said he took a longthanusual break between seasons to regain some semblance of a life as well as to avoid the chaotic production schedule of the show s first three seasons when he would be promoting the show s premiere while still writing and shooting new episodes For the first time he s written a full season of scripts before shooting begins allowing for a little more polish and ambition in the season What kind of ambition Louis CK would will include more stories that span more than one episode as well as shorter ones There will be more straightahead comedic episodes as well as some that I have a stomach ache about One multipart story for next year he says was originally an idea for a movie Interestingly he added that was also the genesis of the season 1 God episode about Louie s past as a religiouslyguilty kid except that the movie involved statues of the crucified Jesus coming to life and strangling people Before the panel the Paley Center screened two episodes which exemplified the show s range of tones Daddy s Girlfriend Part 2 a sweet disturbing firstdate story gueststarring Parker Posey which includes some glorious scenes of the city at night and BarneyNever which climaxes in a shot of a kid soaking in a diarrheapolluted bathtub First question of course had to be how they simulated the fouled s Girlfriend Louis CK said is an example of how New York City permeates the show both visually and in character Because Louie shoot almost entirely on location a move that cuts costs while making it look more expensive it can capture both the city s sleaze and glorious scenes like a montage of Posey and Louis CK gorging on cured fish at Russ and Daughters And the Posey character he said reflected some dates he had in his early days in the city The thing about New York There are a lot of crazy people who do nt look crazy A few other topics that came up in our interview and in questions from the audience Last year s finale New Year s Eve was shot partly in Beijing though Breard first suggested they shoot in Chinatown One problem once they arrived in China was how much of it in fact looks like Columbus Ohio On the the street in China compared with NYC because people do nt have rights An audience member asked about a scene in season 3 in which a character played by Melissa Leo roughly forces Louie to reciprocate oral sex Louis CK said he did nt consider the scene rape She did what she had to do he said drily though he acknowledged an earlier episode in which his character appears to be molested under anesthesia by a dentist Asked if FX had issues with the content he joked I said either I get raped or I m not doing the show Toughest place to shoot in New York City What s the toughest place to do anything in New York City Yep the subway Could a big network make a show like Louie No he said nor should they When you re making a show for millions of dollars an episode that money comes with a lot as advertisers who do nt want to be near offensive content Our advertisers are what Red Stripe beer They do nt give a fuck what we re doing And that s as it should be he said Louie he said is nt a show for millions of people This is for a few of us he said gesturing to the small soldout auditorium to get together and enjoy a tub of diarrhea Shot in Portland Ore the Falls saga follows the doomed romance of two Mormon youth who discover much more than God whilst doing their mission work Testament of Love picks up the story five years after we last saw the pair of conflicted lovers and is set to take the 2013 festival circuit by storm this fall I caught up with Garcia this week to chat about the film Read our interview after the trailer below Logan Lynn Hi Jon For our readers who have not seen The Falls could you give us the rundown on the story of the original film Jon Garcia The Falls is the story of Chris Merrill and RJ Smith two Mormon missionaries that fall in love on their mission RJ is assigned to live with senior companion Chris Merrill who teaches him the daily regimen of missionary life As teaches the word of our heavenly father they realize there is so much more to life While in the Lynn Sounds hot What moved you to make the first movie Is it autobiographical Garcia I was raised Catholic so I did not live through these experiences the way that RJ and Chris did but I can identify with these characters in many ways I was writing a very different story in 2010 until I spoke with two friends who had grow up Mormon and had such experiences They spoke of the struggle they endured while serving their church and falling in love with the young men they were missionary companions with Neither were excommunicated but what happened on their mission was brought to the attention of their mission president then eventually to their families back home It was a traumatic experience for both of them I was then inspired to change the direction of my story about a young gay teenager living in the middle of Idaho to a 19yearold Mormon young man about to leave home for the first time to go on his mission Lynn The Falls month at the Portland Lesbian and Gay Film Festival Tell me a little bit about the sequel Garcia The Falls Testament of Love takes place five years after their mission The way The Falls concluded was purposefully left openended but my intention was to give the impression that Chris and RJ would get together after their mission and take a road trip across America no longer as elders but as two young men with their whole lives ahead of them The two young men are now 25 and living very different lives Chris is still a devout Mormon and RJ is living out and gay in Seattle Wash An unexpected event leads both men back to the small town where they served their mission As old feelings rise to the surface Chris and RJ risk hurting the ones they love as they pursue their desire to be together Lynn Did you always know there would be a second part to this story Garcia I did nt know I was going Falls however I kept receiving emails from individuals all over the world asking me about the ending and what happened to these young men after their mission I was curious myself and I d played it out in my mind what I thought had happened One day I called Breaking Glass Pictures the distribution company who put out the first movie and I told them I wanted to make a sequel After a lot of discussion I wrote the script presented it to them and was eventually given the green light to make the film Lynn Nice Both films were shot in Portland Ore with a local cast Why Portland Garcia I have shot most of my films in Portland because it is my home and moving the production elsewhere could mean more cost Portland is also graced with a pool of very talented actors We are actually very lucky in that sense I have a great crew that I work with here I make these movies because I have their support Lynn If you could sum up the film in one word what would it be Garcia Longing Lynn How is life for queer Mormons these days Many churches in the evangelical movement are shifting their views Are these changes happening in the Mormon Church as well Garcia From what I know the Mormon Church is trying to change the way they are perceived in the public eye but changes within stakes around the United States are happening very slowly I know a few members of Affirmation the gay and lesbian organization for former and presently practicing Mormons and to my knowledge this is evolving but I ca nt say to what degree I can say that we did have a cast member who was Mormon and her views alone helped me realize that there are a lot of Mormons out there who see nothing wrong with LGBT individuals of faith Lynn We came relatively close What might that have meant for our country s LGBTQ population Garcia I feel that Mitt Romney would have been a step back not only for the LGBT community but for women education the middle class and many other issues Exodus International may not have closed so therefore the exgay movement would still be in effect and DOMA may not have been repealed Editor s note The Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA was not repealed the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the law Section 3 which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for federal purposes I also do nt think we would now have 13 states where gay marriage is legal Garcia Ryan Gosling and Michael Fassbender I d cast them in the gay surfer cowboy movie I ve been wanting to make It s like Brokeback Mountain meets Point Break I grew up in a beach town in south Texas There were many surfer gay I m not sure but one can dream Lynn Yes One can and one should Do you have plans for any more installments of The Falls or does Testament of Love wrap things up for these two Garcia I do nt know it really depends on the reception of this film I already know where I d take the story though Companion novels are already in the works with the first coming out soon by author Marty Beaudet Lynn Cool What s next for you Garcia My film The Hours till Daylight about a Hispanic family in south Texas traumatized by paranormal phenomena will be coming out in early 2014 I shot the film in Bastrop Texas with a crew of three in the spring of 2012 and it was recently picked up for distribution by Zahra Pictures John Neff who was David Lynch s sound designer for years is doing our score and sound design for on this project Lynn That does sound exciting Thanks for chatting with me today Any last words you would like to leave our readers with before we go Garcia I think where we stand as a country on gay and lesbian individuals of faith is one of the most important issues we are facing right now therefore the timing of The Falls Testament of Love could nt be better I hope that people are more than entertained by this film I feel this movie provides perspective on how excluding the LGBT community from religious practices can be detrimental to the human spirit Foster amp Allen on their new autobiography and five decades of success WHEN Tony Allen left technical school in his home town of Moate County Westmeath in 1967 he could not possibly have envisaged the incredible music career that was to follow His story of success is the subject of a new autobiography with his cohort Mick Foster entitled After All These Years Our Story Tony first met Mick Foster when they both played in the same local band The Nightrunners and were both in and out of the Irish Midlands trad scene So how did they eventually get from playing in local bands to performing on TV and the world s concert stages selling millions of records along the way And how did he and Mick end up working as a duo in 1975 Tony takes up the story We had done some gigs in London with the band and Paddy Callaghan had taken over The Prince of Wales pub in Kilburn he says there so the rest of the band went home and we stayed on That was really the start of the duo Mick had been on to me to leave the band The Nightrunners He had seen the Alexander Brothers from Scotland when they came over to Ireland and he thought there should be an Irish version He eventually persuaded me to leave the band and go on the road just the two of us I was playing organ and keyboards at the time and Mick was on the accordion so we went down the road as Foster amp Allen doing the local pubs and traveling all over the country playing pubs and GAA halls At that stage the ballad scene had developed into a sort of cabaret scene A lot of the bands had broken up and formed smaller groups and the cabaret scene was going great In 1978 we signed a record deal with Donie Cassidy We had just released The Blacksmith and then Bunch of Thyme which went to number one in to London with Mick Clerkin and it went into the British record charts We got on Top of the Pops and that really started the whole thing going outside Ireland It then went from strength to strength and we are still kicking around at it In such a long career there must have been many highlights I think for us it would have to be our appearance on Top of the Pops in 1982 says Tony That changed the whole thing for us If you think about it we went from playing the likes of The Prince of Wales in Kilburn or the Irish Club in Birmingham to doing a concert tour of England the big theatres Our records were being played on all the regional stations That was a big change Then in 1983 Maggie came out and Mick McDonagh the man who put the Green Velvet albums together sent the song to Ken Harding in Australia Ken released it as a single and it five weeks so that established us over there Tony was anxious to acknowledge the importance of the Green Velvet compilation albums that did so well in the British charts Because they were backed by a TV advertising campaign they brought Irish folk music into the mainstream Apart from Foster amp Allen tracks they featured De Dannan with Mary Black The Fureys Irish Mist and Brendan Grace who was huge at the time It meant people who might not have been too familiar with Irish folk music were now being exposed to it at peak viewing times and they latched on to it The importance of national TV advertising can not be overstated in the success of Foster amp Allen In relation to the way that daytime television has changed Tony said In the old days you could do something like Pebble Mill at One and the whole country would see it You could be on all day now and hardly anyone would see it because there are so many stations We have the book out now which tells our own individual stories and the story of the band A new single is also due out shortly plus of course the UK tour coming up It s good to be still at it after all these years which by coincidence just happens to be the title of the book Foster amp Allen begin their British tour at the end in Tunbridge Wells on October 29 and tour throughout November Failure in basic care of Savita Halappanavar Image caption Savita Halappanavar 31 died after a miscarriage in University Hospital Galway last October A report into the death of Savita Halappanavar and related issues has found a failure to provide the most basic elements of care in her case The pregnant 31yearold died in an Irish hospital in October last year She had asked for a termination after being told she was having a miscarriage but staff refused Days later she died from infection A 257page report by the Health Information and Quality Authority HIQA was issued on Wednesday It found there were many missed opportunities that if acted on might have changed the outcome for her The report was conducted after the HIQA was asked by the Republic of Ireland s Health Service Executive to investigate the safety quality and standards of services provided at University Hospital Galway Mrs Halappanavar died one week after she was admitted to the hospital when she in care The report also revealed wide variations in clinical care in the country s 19 public maternity hospitals and units It stated there is no nationally agreed definition of maternal sepsis and inconsistent recording of it nationally as well as no centralised approach to reporting maternal morbidity and mortality As a result it is impossible to properly assess the performance and quality of maternity services nationally the report found In the case of Mrs Halappanavar the report said there was a failure to recognise she was developing an infection and to act on her deteriorating condition It found that University Hospital Galway did not have effective arrangements to regularly record and monitor her condition and that the management of the delivery of maternity services was not consistent with best practices The report stated the findings in the Halappanavar case bore a disturbing resemblance to the findings of an HSE inquiry into the death of Tania McCabe and her son Zach in 2007 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda County Louth care of clinically deteriorating pregnant women It also called for a national maternity services strategy to ensure women receive safe high quality and reliable care Medical misadventure The inquest into the death of Mrs Halappanavar took place in April and found she had died due to medical misadventure An HSE clinical review report was published in June which found inadequate assessment and monitoring and a failure to recognise the gravity of the situation and the increasing risk to her life Her husband Praveen has initiated legal action against the HSE Speaking at the publication of the report HIQA director of regulation Phelim Quinn extended his sympathies to Mr Halappanavar He said the report would be a further difficult read for him and his family Tommy Robinson has left the EDL But this is a change of key not a change of message Tommy Robinson feels he can no longer keep extremists in the party at bay Getty Images The announcement yesterday morning that Tommy Robinson and Kev Carroll cofounders of the English Defence League were to leave the group took many by surprise By removing himself from the farright movement Tommy Robinson is changing his tactics but as I learned at the press conference last night there s little to suggest he will be denouncing Islamophobic views anytime soon Only this year Tommy was filmed at an EDL organised street demonstration shouting how Islam is not a religion of peace it is fascist and violent and last night Tommy refused to take back comments made in the past concerning his views on Islam He seemed wholly uncomfortable when faced with questions regarding his views on Halal cuisine and would not retract past comments that mosquebuilding in the UK should be Tommy still asserted he stands by past comments made about links between Islam and paedophilia However last night the Quilliam foundation who broke the news of Robinson s retreat from the EDL were keen to reiterate that Tommy and Kev do not hate Muslims The two journalists next to me both commented at this point something here is nt right When asked if this was the easy way out for him Tommy said that he only got 45 minutes sleep last night He d neglected his wife and family he said and told us he was dreading going home At one point I came close to feeling sorry for the bloke who has had such a difficult time of it but then I remembered he s Tommy Robinson from the EDL It needs to be made clear these men last night made no attempt to denounce actions of the EDL in the past nor the principles the EDL stands for Nawaz cofounder and chairman of Quilliam an anitextremism group had only started speaking to the exEDL frontmen over the last couple of days It certainly was made no clearer at the press conference last night as to what the EDL leadership had done to prove they were nt actually racist but Nawaz pointed out that he and his colleague were Muslim and therefore how could Tommy be racist In essence I was left wondering what on earth was going on For Tommy and Kev it s clear they have a lot to gain from moving away from the EDL a failing organisation described by the men as out of control This way they can be seen as more moderate a voice of reason from the right Moreover with groups such as UKIP finding such electoral success in the UK is it any wonder that Tommy and his cronies are looking for a more democratic way of pursuing their racist agenda However for Quilliam this Nawaz was clear last night that the exEDL leaders were to receive training and education through his foundation to educate them on Islam However there was no plan presented of how this would take place or what Quilliam envisaged doing with their latest recruits Speaking to an international relations scholar last night at the University of Oxford who has spent time working with Muslim community groups in the north I was told that nobody in the Muslim community takes Quilliam seriously Last night Tommy asserted there are problems and we need to solve them We must confront the problem but marching and chanting is offending moderates Clearly he and Carroll are trying a change of tactic but their dangerous views have not suddenly been enlightened We are singing from the same songsheet just the same sheet as Quilliam against Islamism Carroll told the audience Forget Quilliam the songsheet Carroll and Robinson hold is full of bile and a change of key wo nt change Labour has acknowledged that it still has its work cut out to win the argument on welfare after a party pollster said it faced a very severe challenge to overcome a Tory lead on benefit cuts A spokesman agreed that the party would have to work hard to sell to voters its plans for a social security cap after the leak of a recording of a briefing by James Morris from Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research Reflecting a belief that the Tories are scoring better with the public on the welfare issue Morris is quoted as saying The challenge is very severe if you look at politically salient target groups those numbers get worse Morris told a meeting at the Trades Union Congress last Friday that a poll of 3000 voters had found that 53 of those questioned supported changes to the benefits system Just over a quarter 27 opposed the changes The poll also found that the only groups of voters who opposed the government s changes party was not well placed to win over floating voters on the issues Opponents included Labour voters and people who identified with the party as well as Guardian and Mirror readers Morris told the meeting at the TUC which commissioned the poll that support for the government s reforms increased among voters that would be targeted by the Tories and Liberal Democrats More than three quarters 77 of ConservativeLib Dem voters supported the reforms Nearly two thirds 64 of LabourConservative swing voters supported the government Priti Patel the Tory MP for Witham said Labour s rocketing welfare bill is what got us into this mess in the first place Ed Miliband is the same old Labour he has opposed every one of the 83bn of welfare savings so far and he still wants unlimited benefit handouts It s taxpayers who would pay the price for this through higher taxes and higher bills A Labour spokesman said We always have more to do people recognise our spending cap on social security spending will tackle the underlying causes of rising social security bills The party announced in the summer that it would cap the structural elements of social spending on areas such as longterm worklessness and on housing costs The cap is designed to target the longterm pressures on welfare spending However the polling for the TUC did produce some encouraging figures for Labour in other areas It found that 77 of those questioned said poor children should always be supported regardless of the behaviour of their parents The polling was carried out just before the Labour conference at which Miliband unveiled his new slogan Britain can do better than this The New Statesman quotes the former Labour leader Lord Kinnock as saying that Miliband said he had inspired the slogan A hacker by the name of Jason thanks gamesonnet was able to briefly gain access to Twitter account for Riot Games CEO Marc Merill taking to the account to threaten the release of a finished but not yet released League of Legends card game It is unclear whether the threat was actually real or not Jason claimed that Riot does nt want you to play this game stating that its a standalone game I have the server and client source A login screen for the unreleased game was also released showing the title League of Legends Supremacy which apparently matches up with a previous domain registration last year by Riot Games An Imgur gallery was also uploaded with various game

with Jellyfish born in space are nt happy on Earth Author Disclosure statement Rebecca Helm does not work for consult own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above Why send jellyfish to space Well because it s awesome which is true of anything involving space But mostly because of little crystals that they keep in their bodies and what these crystals can tell us about longterm human space travel When a jellyfish grows it forms calcium sulfate crystals at the margin of its body termed a bell These crystals are surrounded by a little cell pocket coated in specialised hairs which are equally spaced around the bell When jellyfish turn the crystals roll down with gravity to the bottom of the pocket moving the cell hairs which in turn send signals to nerve cells In this way jellyfish are able to sense this to happen is gravity Humans have gravity sensing structures too and therein lies the crux in space with no gravity will these structures grow normally If humans ever want to colonise places in deep space then we may need to have kids in zero gravity Will these kids develop normal gravity sensing even after growing up without it For jellyfish at least things are nt so good After developing in space these astronaut jellyfish have a hard life back on Earth While development of the sensory pockets appears normal many more jellies had trouble getting around once on the planet including pulsing and movement abnormalities compared to their Earthbound counterparts Weightlessness it s my thinghfiguiere Human gravity sensing is nt exactly like that of jellyfish but it s close The human inner ear contains both fluids and small crystals which tell us not only the angle of our head but also our forward momentum Even with these differences there is enough In other words if jellyfish babies have trouble gravity sensing on Earth after being in space human babies may be in trouble too Human births in space could mean a lifetime of Earthly confusion Long term space travel will be fraught with developmental challenges to the babies growing onboard If the jellyfish say growing up in space is nt so great we better be listening Steven Wilson Puts Projects Aside To Work On Yes XTC Remasters Producer performer songwriter

material was inspired by his childhood experiences as the son of a Roscommon based garda sergeant and of his experiences of the rural community around the fading Rockingham Estate Before assuming his teaching career he lived at the former gardener s house of the Rockingham Estate at Grevisk outside Boyle The burning of the big house was described in his books as well as its prior influence in the area In the play The Rockingham Shoot he describes the abuse given by teachers to local children who mitched off school for the shillings to be earned beating pheasants for the aristo toffs big annual shooting event Now the cutstone gardener s house is for sale for 125000 The house which is almost 200 years old was built in 1825 to house the head gardener for the big estate who was boss of a stands at 1800 square feet with gardens of almost an acre It s located just outside the walls of the Rockingham Estate famously owned by the Stafford King Harmon family who owned 22000 acres There are four bedrooms and three bathrooms a kitchen with a Belfast sink and two cosy reception rooms both with open fireplaces There s a boat house to the side of the house which is proximate to Lough Key And he grumbles at length about the injustices of a court case about the band s royalties in the 457page book as well as discussing his bitterness about record deals He reveals he was in his mid30s when he met Jake Walters at a dinner he attended in Notting Hill Morrissey wrote Jake and I fell together in deep collusion whereby the thorough and personal could be the only possible way and we ate up each minute of the day There will be no secrets of flesh or fantasy he is me and I am he He went on We managed to parrot on nonstop for two years in a jocular fourthform stew of genius and silliness Morrissey recalls how his neighbour the writer Alan Bennett had noticed the relationship had reached its end when he visited and pointed out to them You have nt spoken a word to one another since I arrived The musician whose muchanticipated book called Autobiography has been male teacher as he covers his early years He points out the member of staff took an interest in him massaging his hurt wrist with slow and sensual strokes and claims the same man was eyeing him up as he dried himself after a shower following a games lesson The 54yearold also talks about his strong attachment to Iranianborn friend Tina Dehghani whom he met while living in Los Angeles Tina is my first experience of uncluttered commitment And of their discussion about children he said Tina and I discuss the unthinkable act of producing a mewling miniature monster Morrissey paints a vivid picture of his early years with discussions of the merits of the TV shows he remembered as a child And his writing is as scabrous as the interviews he has given over the past three decades He calls his colleague Mike Joyce a pounder drummer when he discusses what he thought were the injustices of a lengthy court case in which Joyce the band s earnings The star also talks of his unhappiness with Geoff Travis the man who signed them to his record label Rough Trade even though he had not been interested in hearing their demo until Marr insisted He claims they were poorly treated by Travis despite the label s success being built on The Smiths and points out at one stage of the book There will never be one instance in the Smiths history with Rough Trade when Geoff would treat the band to a lavish nonetoocheap dinner or salutary clink of earthenware Morrissey also reveals he was offered roles in both Eastenders and Emmerdale and was the victim of a kidnap attempt in Mexico back in Sept 2007 Council plans to chop down 300 trees in historic park Trees to be felled in Merrion Square Up to 300 trees in Merrion Park are to be chopped downUp to 300 trees in Merrion Park are to be chopped downUp to 300 trees in Merrion Park are to be chopped downUp to 300 trees in Merrion Park are to be chopped down CITY officials have drawn up controversial plans to chop down up to 300 trees in one of the capital s most popular parks They believe that they should be removed to protect some of the other trees and give Merrion Square Park a facelift The Herald has seen provisional plans proposing that hundreds be taken down across the park A conservation management plan is due to be presented to city politicians during a meeting of the South East Area Committee next month The park is extremely popular with residents and is often visited by tourists In an event to mark Ireland s Presidency of the European Union earlier this year visitors tree in tribute to deceased or unwell loved ones The socalled Touring Tama or hanky tree was displayed in the park for a period during the summer But plans drawn up by officials could see many trees of its like chopped down A council spokesman refused to be drawn on the exact number up for the cut Dublin City Council intends to prepare a conservation management plan for Merrion Square Park he said It s planned to provide details on this to the November meeting of the South East Area Area Committee No decisions have been made on the plan at this stage but further details will be available following the November meeting The news attracted mixed reactions from city representatives Lord Mayor Oisin Quinn told the Herald that officials wanted to remove them for several reasons among them to protect older tree species There is in the region of 1000 trees in the park I understand he said to revitalise it A lot of these trees are newer and it is felt that some of the older species need to be protected There are safety issues as well Parts of the park are quite dark as they are dense with trees so the removal of some of them will improve these areas However the Labour politician added that he had urged officials to ensure that a greater number of trees were planted than removed in the city But independent councillor Mannix Flynn said that he believed there would be a great deal of opposition to the removal of the trees from the popular venue This park is an integral part of Dublin s southside he added The trees give it a wonderful authenticity and I certainly believe that any plans to remove hundreds of them will be met with significant opposition While tree removal is necessary the scale of removal being mentioned here is nothing short of alarming All three were members of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart at the time of the alleged abuse over a 20year period from the late 1960s to the 1980s Mr MacCarthaigh with an

Carrignavar on various dates between 1979 and 1985 Garda Gary Morris told the court that Mr O Dalaigh replied I two charges were put to him Insp Mary King said that the DPP had directed that Mr Mac Carthaigh and Mr O Dalaigh be tried on indictment before a judge and jury at Circuit Court level and said she was seeking a remand until December 12 for preparation of the book of evidence in both cases Mr OBrien with an address at Woodview Mount Merrion Avenue Blackrock Dublin was charged with one count of indecent assault on one boy at Colaiste Chroi Naofa on a date between 1985 and 1986 Sgt Bill Daly gave evidence of his arrest charge and caution and told the court that Mr OBrien had nothing to say after he was charged Insp King said the DPP had directed that Mr OBrien s case could be dealt with at District Court level and she applied to have him remanded on his own bond of 500 to appear at Cork District Court on December 12 It ll shave hundreds off your razor bill A Cork man who developed a device that resharpens razor blades has been inundated with enquiries after revealing his invention could save shavers up to 360 a year The patented Blade Saver devised by Barry Sheehan from Passage West allows people to use their razor blades regardless of make or model over and over again Mr Sheehan highlighted that blades with can cost up to 4 each add hundreds of euro to a shopping bill on a yearly basis In fact most people spend between 180 and 360 per year on the leading replacement blades depending on personal usage and model of razor with most lasting for just six good shaves However with his new batteryoperated device which retails at 15 across 11 local stores the cost of being clean shaven is significantly less as it allows a single blade to last up to 10 times longer I was sick and tired The idea came at a point in my life where I was wondering whether to invest in my pension fund or invest in something I started myself It was a question of selfbelief and I decided to go with the latter The Blade Saver which comes with a full set of easytofollow instructions works with light pressure from a highspeed rotating leather head and the process takes less than a minute The practice can be repeated up to 10 times increasing the lifetime of a razor blade Mr Sheehan outlined that along with saving money it also allows people to do their bit for the environment The Blade Saver is available at Hickeys of Maylor Street Coleman s Car Care in Wilton Shopping Centre Twilight News St Patricks Street South Link Service Station Cork Airport Duty Free and

Britain and Europe appearing on the labels of dairy products that we consume as well as in the countryside itself Yet it represents only a part of the European dairy industry What of the cows that we do not see Those with little or no access to those fields those who are tethered and those who are pushed to their limits by excessive milk production This may not be a familiar image to many of us but it is the stark reality for a shockingly high proportion of dairy cows across Europe Last summer my charity Compassion in World Farming carried out a series of undercover investigations at over 50 farms in Germany Denmark and Spain to find out what conditions were like for dairy cows in the EU We were appalled by what we found Many cows were living in zerograze conditions without lie down and move a few steps in any direction In Germany 11 of the 14 farms we visited kept their cows tethered with chains in tiestalls some of them for the whole year Living spaces were often barren and without straw leading to painful sores and swollen joints from the hard floor and some cows were found sitting in their own faeces These cows were frequently forced to their limits to produce high yields of milk becoming bony with exhaustion and slaughtered often at a young age when their yield began to diminish It makes for harrowing reading I know It s even harder to see This research comes from just three countries but is we suspect a good representation of dairy farming across Europe It is estimated that over one third of dairy cows in the EU are zerograzed and that a further one fifth are tethered in tiestalls for at least part of the year Even in the UK it life indoors It seems ludicrous that such injustices should be legal but the problem is dairy cows are not specifically protected by EU law Unlike other farm animals such as poultry and pigs there is no EU legislation which refers to dairy cow welfare specifically Last October Compassion joined with the World Society for the Protection of Animals WSPA and ice cream maker Ben and Jerry s in forming the Supporting Better Dairy coalition The aim of our campaign is to urge the European Commission to bring in a speciesspecific Directive in order to ensure a set of minimum welfare standards for dairy cows across Europe Today 23 October we will present the signatures of more than 250000 EU citizens who agree to a representative of the European Commission We believe that every cow should have access to pasture during the grassgrowing season and be liberated from cruel practices such as tethering that we encountered in our investigations Cows should be fed in a way that meets their dietary needs be measures put in place to prevent their pain and suffering Cows are intelligent sentient beings that deserve our respect and better protection It is my hope that this meeting will be a significant step towards the much needed action for ensuring dairy cow welfare Latest Videos Infographic consumers

provide an exceptional environment in which to live NewSat s 600 million satellite could see it join Australia s largest businesses or crash Tuesday 29 October 2013 031 Myriam Robin Share On the outskirts of Adelaide sits what s called a teleport It receives and transmits satellite signals to geostationary satellites and sells that bandwidth on to third parties It s one of two teleports owned by NewSat The other is in Perth Due to a mix of low rainfall geographical position stateoftheart engineering and political stability both teleports are considered some of the best places in the world from which to secure satellite bandwidth offering uptimes of nearly 100 NewSat a microcap satellite company listed on the ASX does not currently own any satellites It s a middle man It buys bandwidth from the handful of major satellite companies and sells it on to governments and companies in the telecommunications and resource industry But that s about to change For the past few months NewSat s CEO to raise the 600 million necessary to build and launch a satellite It was nt easy When he started his company had a market capitalisation of just 60 million But he s pulled it off Through a mix of export development funds and institutional investment NewSat has the money to build its first satellite Jabiru 1 is due to lift off in 2015 If that launch is successful NewSat will be well on track to become one of Australia s largest most profitable companies The barriers to entry in building launching and operating satellites are extraordinary But as governments and corporations increase their usage of highquality communications their need for satellite bandwidth grows For companies able to offer new satellites there s a huge amount of money to be made And NewSat is looking to cash in The reason we re launching a satellite is because we just ca nt get enough capacity from other vendors Ballintine tells SmartCompany At the moment satellite producers we add value services to do it and we onsell that bandwidth That s a 30 margin business By launching our own satellite we become masters of our own capacity and we go from a 30 margin business to an 80 margin business That s why he could raise the money The demand for satellite bandwidth is huge Already Jabiru 1 has sold 20 of its capacity bringing in 800 million Once it s launched Ballintine says it could bring in 3 billion in revenue with earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation EBITDA of at least 150 million a year And that s just one satellite NewSat owns eight orbital slots There are 160 in the world one for every two degrees along the equator Into the eight slots it owns NewSat can put 20 satellites It s already got plans for Jabiru 2 3 4 and 5 NewSat got its start through million in 2005 when its previous owners decided to sell their Australian operations They re very good teleports but there are 1700 in the world overall Ownership of the teleports was nt enough to break into the satellite game That took financing A lot of it The bulk of the money came on loan from the American and French governments Building the satellite will create 1000 jobs at Lockheed Martin in the United States And building the launcher will create 600 jobs at French company Arianespace Both those governments spent a year doing due diligence on our contracts and our projects and decided to lend us 400 million at 2 interest per annum That s why export money is the best money you can get It s cheap money because you re providing jobs NewSat itself directly employs 75 people But the hundreds of temporary jobs it would create in the United States and France got it 400 million in funding NewSat then put 50 million of its million and raised equity worth 100 million When it came to private investors the bulk of interest came from the US and UK Initially we were laughed out of everyone s offices in Australia Ballintine says We were a little company raising 600 million in a financial community that had no way of understanding anything about satellite technology Australian analysts understand resources and digging holes It was just the wrong place to start So we started in markets that understood space and satellites Funding the first satellite is murder The due diligence we had to go through was an enormous task But since they started NewSat s market cap has risen from 60 million to 300 million As the company gets bigger raising the funds for satellites will get easier But one huge risk remains that of the satellite crashing to the ground That s why NewSat is going with Arianespace to build its launcher The French company has nt satellite is big By global standards it s huge Ballantine says realistically Arianespace was the only company who had a launcher big enough to carry it The technical aspects of the satellite and launcher are wholly built to minimise risk The satellite design aims to change as little as possible from previous successful launches so as not to introduce any new design flaws Satellites stay up for at least 15 years so the engineers are highly conservative using only materials that have been tried and tested as opposed to the newest innovations As one of NewSat s engineers said to SmartCompany If a bolt has nt flown before we do nt want it If all else fails NewSat pays 36 million in insurance premiums every year It also owns the orbital slot next door so it could migrate some of the contracts it s already sold to Jabiru 2 which it hopes to launch a few months after the first satellite But launch failure would be a huge even though there has nt been an Arianespace failure in 57 launches an explosion is always a risk Ballintine says If it works though the possibilities are extraordinary NewSat could come from virtually nowhere to being one of Australia s largest companies The sums speak for themselves Ballintine says satellite companies typically trade at multiples of between eight to 12 times EBITDA The EBITDA on NewSat s first satellite is close to 200 million If NewSat launches five that s a billion in EBITDA right there which you d then multiply by at least eight to get a multibillion dollar market capitalisation It s not just a wild stab Ballintine says If we get our act right and we launch multiple satellites there s no question this could be a very large company indeed Myriam Robin Myriam

Limited ASXELT Cleveland Project Tungsten Potential Brisbane Oct 29 2013 AEST ABN Newswire Elementos Limited ASXELT OTCMKTSELTLF Elementos or the Company is pleased to announce a Conceptual Exploration Target and work program for Foley s tungsten zone at Cleveland Independent consultants Mining One have reported an Exploration Target for Foley s zone of between 72000 and 120000 tonnes of contained WO3 below 850m RL The Exploration Target defined from 26 diamond drill holes totaling 6796 metres is tabulated below The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature There has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource The Exploration Target is in addition to the previously reported Inferred Mineral Resource for Foley s zone above 850m RL which is more intensively drilled The Inferred Mineral Resource above 850m RL estimated independently by Mining 389Mt 030 WO3 for total contained metal of 13000 tonnes WO3 Foley s tungsten zone represents an exciting new opportunity for the Company and the potential of the tungsten deposit has not previously been recognised Tungsten is a highvalue metal with supplies of tungsten outside of China which controls approximately 84 of the market difficult to secure The Company will now commence a work program to study the development potential of the project Cleveland Tungsten Project At the Cleveland project the Foley s tungsten deposit is located approximately 350 metres below the mine portal and largely separate from the lodes that constitute the Cleveland tincopper resource the primary shortterm development focus of the Company The Foley s tungsten mineralisation occurs principally as wolframite Fe Mn WO3 hosted in both the stockwork around and within a greisenised porphyry dyke The Company s future development scenario for the Foley s tungsten deposit envisages an underground caving style operation and recovery of saleable concentrates through standard gravity Tasmanian minerals province is well supported by developed infrastructure and a strong mining culture Cleveland is linked to Burnie export port by sealed roads Accessible power runs through the Cleveland exploration licence area and there is abundant processing water available The Burnie region has a large available and industrial and mine savvy workforce Exploration Target Mining One have independently reviewed historical data relating to the Foley s tungsten deposit and defined a geological model and Exploration Target outlining its potential The Exploration Target which is separate to the JORC Inferred Mineral Resource has been defined from 26 diamond drill holes into Foley s zone totaling 6796 metres sampled and assayed over 25 metre intervals Drillhole intercepts in mineralisation totaled 3638 metres at a lengthweighted average grade of 020 WO3 The tungsten bearing stockwork is currently considered to dip vertically and has a known strike length of about 300 metres an across strike width of up to 300 metres and a down dip extent of 900 metres Elementos is an Australian ASXlisted stage tincopper and tungsten project in Tasmania together with a number of prospective copper and gold assets in South America and Australia GBM Resources has defined a 25 kilometre long semicontinuous copperinsoil anomaly at its Mt Morgan goldcopper project in Queensland GBM Resources ASX GBZ recent field work has defined a 25 kilometre long semicontinuous copperinsoil anomaly at its Mt Morgan goldcopper project in Queensland Notably the zone of porphyrystyle hydrothermal alteration with associated copper mineralisation at the Oakey Creek prospect remains open to the north Extensive scattered copper oxide along with native copper was observed in outcrop The company has also defined a northwest trending regional structure by a KTh airborne radiometric anomaly Details The company ranked the prospect area for attention on the strength of a linear KTh airborne radiometric anomaly parallel to the regional structural trend along with the presence of historic copper oxide workings The alteration zone is at least 32 kilometres by 1 kilometre in size and is parallel to and partly overlapping the radiometric anomaly The linear nature of the alteration zone and its orientation suggests fault control to the system scattered throughout the alteration zone and may have a genetic relationship to the alteration and mineralisation Localised zones of intense copperbearing hydrothermal breccia were also observed within the main alteration envelope Copper oxide and occasional native copper is primarily hosted at the boundaries of the angular fine grain green clasts within the breccia The copperinsoil anomaly generally correlates well with the broad alteration zone and the breccia Rockchip sampling within the alteration and breccia units produced a number of assays returning greater than 03 copper with peak results of 674 copper 398ppm silver and 52ppb gold Anomalous gold in soil is also present within the soil survey area with a peak assay of 02ppm gold with 31 samples returning greater than 100ppb gold However the pattern of gold in soil does not correlate particularly well with copper and the low level gold response in the rockchip samples indicating that more work is required to understand the gold anomalism at Oakey Creek The forward program at Oakey Creek Prospect will see extensions to the current soil north along with continued detailed mapping and rockchip sampling Ground Induced Potential IP geophysical surveys will then be considered to help define targets within the large alteration zone for drill testing The Mt Morgan Project The Mount Morgan Project is located 40 kilometres southwest of Rockhampton Queensland close to the world class Mt Morgan CopperGold mine which produced in excess of 80M ounces of gold Au and 400000 tonnes of copper Cu metal Historic exploration in the Mount Morgan area has primarily focused on the discovery of a Mount Morgan analogue which has up until recently been interpreted by many as a VHMS massive sulphide type Until recent GBM work no activity targeting intrusion related systems had been completed nor had there been thorough examination and interpretation of geophysical datasets or detailed compilation of existing exploration data Proactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX Small and Midcap

destinations Sheep s Head and Clonakilty together with Carlingford Loop Head Mulranny and Cavan who make up the four other award winners in Ireland EDEN is an acronym for European Destinations of Excellence The project was set up by the European Union to enhance the visibility of and promote networking between the best destinations in Europe The conference will be attended by some of the top tourism personnel in Europe John Tobin chairman of the Sheep s Head and Bantry Tourism Co Operative explained that this meeting will give us a chance to learn from and network with some of the top tourist destinations in Europe We hope to be able learn and help increase tourism and jobs in West Cork Michael ONeill from Fernhill House Hotel in Clonakilty is the chairman of the Irish EDEN network and a member of the European board of administrators of the project Michael gave the concluding speech at last years conference and will be speaking again this year Michael said I am looking forward to helping to ensure that the network grows in the right way We are putting together a marketing plan with Failte Ireland that we hope will raise awareness of the EDEN project and bring visitors to our regions It really is an exciting time It s been an eventful week to say the least The Wednesday before last was spent at Stade de France preparing for Saturday s Parisian derby It was a lovely sunny wintry day in Paris kicking balls for two hours on the beautiful Stade de France turf ahead of the meeting with Stade Francais And then we were heading to Charles de Gaulle airport for the flight home to my testimonial dinner Thursday night s dinner at City Hall was an overwhelming and hugely enjoyable experience but time for reflection was scarce as I was at the airport flying home at 515am on Friday morning back in Paris for the captain s run followed by kicking practice for all the backs I m lucky it was just a halfday because Thursday night rolled into Friday and needless to say I had no problem sleeping the night before the big derby I must say following that Wednesday kicking session at Stade de France there was a did on Johnny There s life in the old dog yet I m just glad he returned the favour with another 100 kicking return in the match on Saturday night We were by far the better side but never put Stade Francais away and we very nearly paid the ultimate price as they lay siege to our line in the last three minutes The plan for this week was to leave Johnny in Irish camp all week as the Racing coaches are very pleased with his contribution thus far and from several weeks ago it was earmarked that he would not be involved in tomorrow s match against Biarritz That however changed on Tuesday morning when Juan Hernandez broke down in training with a hamstring injury It s thought his recovery period will be four to five weeks and it s an untimely injury to say the least Johnny will start on the bench against Biarritz as a result and that may change again if Racing s other flyhalf in the squad Jonathan Wisniewski sidelined for the last five matches He looks ready to play but has only had one meaningful training session so it s hard to tell From Johnny and Ireland s perspective ahead of the November Tests it is not ideal but like all good players he will make the necessary adjustments required to keep performing on a Saturday From Ireland s point of view they would have wanted to give him a weekend off but you do nt have a weekend off if you re sitting on the bench He had a flight from Dublin to Paris last night he ll train today with the team on the pitch fly ParisBiarritz Saturday morning and then fly BiarritzDublin on Sunday All going well for us he could have done without that and the coaches wanted to give him every chance Yesterday morning went well for Wisniewski and the other side of it is it could be worse for Johnny he could be starting against Biarritz but the club are actually trying to do whatever they have to look after their bread and butter and that s the Top 14 Now he ll have to be careful how he manages his workload next week We do nt know whether Joe Schmidt will play him in all three internationals but you d think he d be playing against Australia and New Zealand anyway And playing Samoa first up they re no pushovers either It s Test rugby and you need the result Joe Schmidt wants a winning start and I think he d go as strongly as he can with his team selection against the Samoans There s no doubt Johnny s the numberone choice at flyhalf and if he does nt play this weekend for Racing he ll play against Samoa The question for Schmidt is if he togs out warms up and comes on for 50 minutes at Biarritz Joe s got to decide what s best for his team and maybe that s starting someone else Johnny would be in great shape if he got the weekend off playing three weeks out of four was ideal but now Johnny s probably going to be playing 10 weeks in a row which means now he s entering dangerous territory in terms of injury That said the coaches here want to get the best out of Johnny too The games here are probably a little bit slowerpaced than a European Cup game and there s a lot more kicking for territory than you d see at home What he s got watch is the amount of training he does during the week If you train very hard during the Tuesday Wednesday Thursday you re covering as much miles in each of those days as you are on a game day and that s a tough ask As an Irish pro you get pushed hard during the week and what he has to do now is the reverse of that and manage that because it s not as if he s getting beaten up in any of those games and I do nt think the games So perhaps the overplaying argument is being overplayed a little bit in Ireland There s certainly a double purpose to it in order to keep players in Ireland you can see that The reality is yes he is playing a lot of rugby but he is being managed well and he is looking after himself exceptionally well He s based in a fivestar hotel and he gets the best medical treatment the best conditioning and I think he enjoys it The important thing for Johnny is from a mental point of view that he has the hunger there Instead of going to Irish camp and looking to get through he has to be going there looking to excel because that s what international rugby is about So it depends on what mental attitude he brings to it and that s never usually in question where Johnny is concerned With the tax and legal changes announced by the Irish Government during the week it ll be interesting to see how many of his Irish This rule change which means players no longer need to finish their careers in Ireland to avail of certain tax breaks will I feel have significant implications for Irish rugby It is a game changer and rugby agents around Ireland will have been smiling on Tuesday morning when the news broke because their job has become so much easier and the opportunities for their players are endless now FG s women trio quit council over family pressures ALL three of Fine Gael s female politicians on Dublin City Council are stepping down at next summer s local elections the Herald has learned Councillors Clare Byrne Edie Wynne and Mary OShea say the workload has lumped too much pressure on their family lives and careers The women who are all mothers have decided to leave the council in what is a significant blow to party headquarters Fine Gael currently has 12 councillors in the city three of whom are female The party will now attempt to field a number of firsttime candidates in a bid to retain the seats vacated by its female contingent DISHEARTENED Cllr Byrne who is a former deputy mayor of Dublin last night said she has become completely disheartened with work as a local representative I have a threeyearold daughter and I got major stick for missing meetings even when I was in the final days of my pregnancy barely afford to put daughter Amber in creche If I was a bit older perhaps I d stick the council out But I m turning 30 this week and I ve just become so disheartened with it all We do nt have the support we need Sometimes I m out with my husband or with my friends and I m getting pulled over about things It s too difficult to be accessible every minute of the day Cllr Wynne admitted last night that it is remarkable that all three women in the Fine Gael group are stepping down I ve been on the council for seven years now and I really enjoyed it she said But as you know elections are very demanding It s the right time to say goodbye I have young grandchildren now to keep me occupied CAREER However I will continue to try and help people Meanwhile Cllr OShea who a decision between council work and her career It s very hard to find time for both your career and your council work and I had to make a choice she said I count myself very lucky to have served on the council for seven years and I certainly have no regrets Victoria Lambert To any man rushing out to buy the new overthecounter fertility test available from Boots I say this enjoy the excitement while it lasts For you the chance to find out whether your sperm count is normal or low may feel like one small step for a man But women know that when that first packet of SpermCheck Fertility drops into the shopping basket you ve taken one thumping great leap for mankind straight into an abyss of anxiety Today that quickie test taking 10 minutes available for just 2999 may make you feel in control of your end of the fertility business revealing who is hitting the World Health Organisation s target level of 20 million or more sperm per millilitre Tomorrow you may purchase a second test or a third or bulkbuy online for friends because it was fun or fascinating to do or you dropped the be right and must be due to yesterday s bike ride or those tight trousers or that hot bath or actually because the first test was clearly part of the two per cent margin of error quoted by manufacturers From now on you are just one more minnow swimming about in the maelstrom of an infertility business estimated to be worth 3 billion globally and rising shopping for facts and certainties when all you can really do is grasp at hopes and dreams Welcome gentlemen to our world where women are constantly sold the promise of control over our faces figures and finances but especially over our fertility The world where we ll happily spend all our disposable income and more on products to assist conception from expensive herbal supplements to ovulation kits pregnancy detectors to thermometers The world where oocytes egg cells to the uninitiated are an obsession not a high score in Scrabble For now it s your turn to enter Perhaps you are tempted by some red healing crystals or Ayurvedic medicine or even the prospect of Snowballs cooling underwear still in development and based on the theory that the testes need to be kept cool to produce healthy sperm Or maybe you just want to stock up on one of the vitamin supplements packed full of amino acids and herbs known to thin the blood in the hope of improving erectile quality Of course the reality for men as for women is far less frivolous than my shopping lists suggest Male fertility is in decline as research published last December showed Between 1989 and 2005 average sperm counts fell by a third in a study of 26000 men increasing their risk of infertility according to researchers from the Institut de Veille Sanitaire in St Maurice The quantity of healthy sperm produced was also reduced by a similar proportion The findings published in the journal Human Reproduction confirmed findings over the past Many reasons ranging from tight underwear to toxins in the environment have been advanced to explain the fall but no definitive cause has been found The European Commission has even set up a working group Reprotrain to tackle the increasing crisis around Male Reproductive Biology and Andrology Some men wo nt need the new test They already know or suspect they have a problem it is estimated that problems with sperm account for about a third of known fertility problems but are probably suffering in silence Far less attention after all is paid to the psychological effect failure to conceive can have on men Jo Hemmings a behavioural psychologist and relationship coach says Perhaps because women are deemed to have a stronger maternal instinct than men s paternal instinct and gestate give birth and breast feed they have received more attention than men And so men are often seen as having an almost interdependent role more of a support role to emotions in their own right Men do not have quite the same sort of societal permission to express feelings around infertility she notes Yet for many men there are feelings of inadequacy low selfesteem guilt shame and anger This can often lead to a withdrawal from communication and indeed sexual dysfunction making the problem that much more difficult Old stereotypes have not done much to help Men with fertility problems may find it grimly ironic that until recently all males were considered fertile until proven otherwise even in old age And there were only two realistic ways of altering that a vasectomy or condoms For just as attention has focused on women s experiences of infertility so has the medical establishment concentrated on women s control of fertility Scientists have been talking about a male contraceptive pill since the early 1980s with many women sceptical as to whether they would trust a man to take it but we are research is focusing on combinations of hormones synthetic testosterone and progestogens with some in phase III trials the last stage of clinical trial before a medicine is given a marketing licence Scientists in Israel are looking into how bloodpressure drugs called calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine may alter the metabolism of sperm so that they are not able to fertilise an egg such a pill could be on offer as early as 2015 researchers suggest We wo nt hold our breath In the meantime rising levels of anxiety seem to be doing a better job on suppressing fertility than hormones Researchers note that the increase in the number of men diagnosed with infertility seems to correlate with increasing anxiety in general In July psychiatrists at the University of Cambridge and the University of Hertfordshire reported that more than 8 million people in Britain suffer from anxiety disorders up from 23 million people in a 2007 study Of course infertility makes people anxious raising the possibility of a vicious cycle the man s psychological and physiological reactions should be considered far more seriously than current research would suggest argues Hemmings And yet silence still surrounds the issue in many quarters Visitors to the femaledominated Mumsnet website forum discussing conception quickly learn that there is no such thing as TMI too much information among women desperately seeking reassurance as they attempt to get a BFP Big Fat Positive line on their pregnancy test But hop over to the Men s Health site forum on becoming a dad and users seem more worried about whether their wives will still be attractive after giving birth Look too to the Hollywood stars who refreshingly are admitting to fertility problems more openly than before they are overwhelmingly female You wo nt find many men risking their HeMan reputations A rare exception is Tom Arnold the hero of True Lies and exhusband of Roseanne Barr who said earlier this year I have a very low sperm count I did nt ll be honest Given this backdrop perhaps SpermCheck will help to get men talking about infertility as openly as women do Certainly men and women need to accept when there is a legitimate problem and not be afraid to ask for support At the time of the contraceptive pill being introduced Germaine Greer said The management of fertility is one of the most

Cosatu affiliates declaring it would not be taking part in Tuesday s nationwide protests against etolling and labour brokers Further to that Numsa KZN also called for the resignation of Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini whom it accused of failing to unite the trade union federation and of also being part of the faction that is trying to delay a Cosatu special congress which has been requested by some affiliates Numsa and other affiliates requested the special congress in September to deal with among other things the fate of suspended Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi Responding to these allegations on Sunday Dlamini accused the Numsa KZN leadership of being regionalists The thinking by these people is that because the president of Cosatu comes from KZN then their struggle to remove Dlamini would be much more effective if this call is championed no other region of Numsa has made such a call Dlamini also lambasted the KZN regional secretary of Numsa Mbuso Ngubane saying he had no business pronouncing on Cosatu leadership matters because he is not a worker but an employee of Numsa who is supposed to be servicing the workers Ngubane had accused Dlamini of trying to delay the special congress of Cosatu by allegedly claiming that there was no money to hold it Ngubane said this was an invalid excuse as accommodation and transport costs for delegates to Cosatu congresses were paid for by affiliates Cosatu only has to pay for the venue and lunch for delegates We are not even talking about a fourday congress here but only a twoday congress said Basil Cele the chairman of Numsa in KZN Dlamini however said after the request for the special congress was made he wrote to the different Cosatu affiliates asking for clarity on some matters Up until today not even a single Numsa should consult with their national leadership on that matter Dlamini had wanted to get the proposed agenda for the meeting and some reports from the affiliates that would feed into the organisational report He said he was not reluctant to convene the special congress I want a united Cosatu because a divided Cosatu would not do the workers any good because it would mean that the shield of the workers that is Cosatu has been removed Meanwhile Dlamini said the stayaway would go ahead tomorrow as there was a groundswell of support from Cosatu affiliates Even at the KZN shop stewards council Numsa stood up and through its regional chairman Basil Cele expressed support for the action Why are they now singing a different tune But Cele said his branch had decided against participating in the protests saying there was very little time to mobilise He said the issue first came up at the provincial shop stewards council on November 3 After consultation would be impossible to mobilise successfully Comment Guidelines Has a comment offended you Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the righthand side Click triangle and select Flag as

been keeping tabs of the proceedings on Showtime s That s My Tomboy personality and talent tilt which is creating a buzz because it s the first showcase that s been provided for the country s tomboys TBirds or lesbians Heretofore only male gays had the run of the small screen while their lesbian counterparts were sort of restricted to the sidelines or even the shadows except for the forthright likes of Aiza Seguerra and Charice What seemed to be the problem We asked around and some TV people volunteered their feeling that tomboys were nt as entertaining as flaming fairies They tried too hard to act macho and that made them come off as too tough heavy and humorless to be entertaining But all that s in the past With That s My Tomboy lesbians have been given their own noontime showcase and opportunity to strut their stuff for some of them to shine ADVERTISEMENT True enough the tilt thus far has pretty much decided to play it safe and most of its contestants have been of the young cute and sort of pilyo type nothing too brusque or threatening and absolutely no bulldykes please We do notice that from time to time a less cute and more idiosyncratic tomboy is featured so the tilt may get a bit edgier as the weeks progress and viewers get less uptight EIGENMANN Has lost 30lbs and counting Another upbeat development is the emergence of the tomboy tilt s first real singing discovery who made a strong impression last week by doing a splitgender boygirl act during which she did full vocal justice to both parts of her selfduet In addition she came across as a confident entertainer and personality unlike many other contestants who are merely personable or can dance a little Will the tomboy discovery Knock on wood Elsewhere on the tube we re glad that some obese stars are starting to lose weight For instance Aga Muhlach is beginning to look lighter more boyish and cuter despite his already being in his 40s on his new gamequiz show Let s Ask Pilipinas We hear too

000 SDF personnel expected to assist with relief efforts there and throughout the Philippines Japan s Foreign and Defense Ministry officials said Friday the operation which is expected to swing into full gear as early as next week would mark the biggest mobilization of SDF troops for a relief mission ever overseas With Leyte island and its surrounding waters being used as the primary base for

from US military troops who are working there so we will be able to secure the safety of our personnel he was quoted by local media as saying with reference to instances of looting and gunfire in some of the disasterhit areas that remain unpoliced Next week s deployment from Japan will greatly assist international relief efforts underway Minister Itsunori Onodera said Friday with calls for Japan to bolster medical and rescue efforts which have been hampered by fuel shortages making it difficult for vehicles to access those in need and civil unrest which has compromised the security environment

disembarkation The Japanese government also announced Friday that it was tripling its emergency aid package for the Philippines to more than 30 million with 2million worth of emergency relief goods

Samar Representative Ben Evardone boarded a private plane to undertake an aerial survey of his home province As he scanned the ground below he saw homes demolished structures destroyed and human life decimated Some of the villages were no longer there the lawmaker said barely able to control his emotions When he was finally able to land and saw the bleak fate that befell his provincemates Evardone he knew it would take years before the place could get back on its feet When I saw Lawaan town I told myself the province is gone There is one barangay that was totally wiped out said Evardone who

Michael WeissMichael Weiss is the editor in chief of the Interpreter an online journal that translates and analyzes Russian media Follow him on Twitter michaeldweiss November 21 2013 In late October amendments were made to Article 208 of the Russian Criminal Code outlawing the Organization of or Participation in Illegal Armed Units in foreign countries Intended to stanch the rising flow of radical jihadists from the Russian Federation to Syria and purposefully written to encompass foreign military activities for which the participant need not receive payment the amended law now carries a sixyear prison sentence for anyone found guilty of violating it According to Sergei Smirnov the first deputy director of Russia s Federal Security Service FSB some 300 to 400 fighters mainly from the North Caucasus are thought to have already joined with religious crusaders in trying to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar Article 359 which dates back to 1996 outlaws the more conventionally defined activity of the noncitizen mercenary as in the soldier of fortune who works for pay Funnily enough it s that earlier statute that has already been broken by more than 200 Russians who just returned from a lackluster military performance in Syria Only they were fighting for Damascus not for al Qaeda In late October international media outlets reported that Russian mercenaries appeared to have joined with Syrian army regulars in a fight against rebels After a battle in Homs between regime troops and the Islamic State of Iraq and alSham one of the two main al Qaeda groups in Syria the jihadi website Kavkaz Center known more for its crude propaganda than its empirically verifiable information claimed that among the 100 enemy slain were several Russians One of the dead was even named Aleksei Malyuta from the city of Abinsk in Krasnodar territory Kavkaz posted videos including one reportedly showing a Russian mercenary breaking a piece of well as documents allegedly showing that Malyuta worked as a professional gun for hire for the Moran Security Group a Moscowbased private military company which had contracted a Hong Kongregistered entity called Slavonic Corps Ltd to dispatch armed personnel to Syria According to its website Moran offers targeted approaches in the world s current hot spots such as the Middle East Central Asia and Africa which include the enlistment of local experts in these dynamic and highly sensitive environments As for Slavonic Corps on its website it claims to operate in strict correspondence to Russian law and never takes part in events related to overthrow of governments violating human rights of civilian population and in any other actions violating International Law and Conventions If one judges from some of the nowverified photographs that Kavkaz Center produced these contracted local experts in Syria may have included the thuggish proregime shabiha whose white trucks with mounted machine guns have become symbols of atrocity The story idled for several days until executives of Moran and Slavonic Corps Alexey Badikov a director of Moran whose signature appeared on Malyuta s personnel ID which was obtained by jihadists in Syria told Fontanka reporterDenis Korotkov that Malyuta did indeed work for Moran in 2012 and early 2013 and participated in seagoing operations to protect private merchant ships from piracy though he did nt specify where However Badikov said Slavonic Corps had no relationship with Moran and Moran had nt contracted any work in Syria Fontanka proved that both assertions were false It authenticated the ID documents published by the Kavkaz Center proving that Malyuta did indeed have a contract with Slavonic Corps and was in Syria in October But Malyuta the newspaper found was actually still quite alive and now back in Russia celebrating his return with his brother Sergei who was the acting head of the same security detail in Syria nine days after jihadists prematurely announced Aleksei Malyuta s demise Sergei Malyuta toldFontanka that Slavonic Corps contracted the Russian mercenaries the guard and defense of economic facilities of the Syrian Republic The point was to free the subdivisions of the Syrian army from these duties so that they could take part in the battle against the bandits Sergei Malyuta denied taking part in any clashes with jihadists or other rebels his brother s documents he said were simply stolen out of an unattended backpack As proof of life Aleksei Malyuta sent Fontanka a video taken in Russia in which he was drinking and toasting to his good health Fontanka further verified that all the mercenaries had returned safely but prematurely owing to the failure of the hosts to fulfill their financial obligations which caused problems with the housing and feeding of the fighters from Slavonic Corps The contract apparently had been broken But the story did nt end there In a followup article published on Nov 14 Fontanka revealed that Russia s domestic security service the FSB had arrested two highranking members of Slavonic the criminal code s old Article 359 Moreover since the spring of 2013 Fontana s Korotkov found based on interviews with several excontractors Slavonic Corps had been recruiting former soldiers with combat experience to guard energy facilities in exotic locales for the promise of 4000 per month Recruits were interviewed over the phone before meeting directly with the president of Moran Vyacheslav Kalashnikov a lieutenant colonel in the FSB reserves who introduced himself as a general and explained what the overseas missions would entail A second facetoface interview followed at the Baltic Shooting Center on Alexander Blok Street in St Petersburg where the appropriate forms would be completed and passports ordered Finally recruits were invited to Moscow where they were told in Moran s offices that they d be subcontracted to Syria with Slavonic Corps The men were called up just as soon as they arrived back in St Petersburg Contracts with Hong Kong s Slavonic Corps Limited were literally signed on knees on the According to Oleg Krinitsyn the head of RSBGroup Russia s largest private military company whom Fontanka interviewed the Slavonic Corps team was a shambles from the start Among those guys photographed against a backdrop of Syrian equipment festooned with weapons I noticed a few of our former employees who had been dismissed because of their poor moral character I saw guys with criminal records amongst them This once again confirms that the aim of the re cruiters was not to attract highquality professionals but just to plug a hole with cannon fodder and fast And the boys were sent on contracts that resembled contracts for suicide missions Right away people signed a contract that included a will to bury their remains in their homeland or if that proved impossible in the nation where they died and then be reburied in Russia Dreadful Moreover Krinitsyn told the newspaper the contract these mercenaries signed apparently had been commissioned not by any ministry in Damascus but by Mark Galeotti a New York University professor who specializes in the Russian security services concluded following the Interpreter s translation of the Fontanka exclusives that it is difficult to sustain any notion that at the very least the Russian government did not give this its blessing As recounted by several of them to Fontanka the mercenaries were flown to Beirut and then traveled by car to Damascus before being transferred to a military base in the coastal province of Latakia The Russians say they were greeted as foreign heroes by regime loyalists and housed in the makeshift barracks at the former stables of a horse track alongside Syrian reservists In October according to one recruit there were 267 Slavonic Corps mercenaries in Syria split into two companies one of them made up entirely of Cossacks with the expectation that the total force would grow to 2000 over time They were given assault rifles machine guns and grenade launchers as well as other Sovietera hardware some of it 70 When they spoke to us in Russia they explained that we were going on a contract with the Syrian government they convinced us that everything was legal and in order Like our government and the FSB were on board and involved in the project When we arrived there it turned out that we were sent as gladiators under a contract with some Syrian or other who may or may not have a relationship with the government That meant that we were the private army of a local kingpin But there was no turning back As they said a return ticket costs money and we ll work it off whether we like it or not The manager of the entire outfit in Latakia was Vadim Gusev identified by Fontanka as deputy director of Moran According to documents Foreign Policy obtained from Slavonic Corps registry Gusev also owns all 10000 shares of the Hong Kongbased company The one and only actual campaign Slavonic s mercenaries participated in control of oil fields in Syria s eastern province of Deir ezZor Portraits of Assad and Baathist flags were stuck to Hyundai buses and JMC trucks as the men set off on a 350mile trek eastward from Latakia across rebelinfiltrated terrain Signs that their safety was nt really a paramount concern of their hosts became apparent immediately Battleready T72 tanks were replaced by older dilapidated T62s before the mission began back in Latakia A Syrian helicopter evidently mistaking the Russian convoy for enemy action got itself tangled in power lines and crashed on top of the entire mercenary column albeit wondrously without killing anyone Then on Oct 18 the Slavonic Corps fighters met their bathetic Little Bighorn after getting stuck in the town of alSukhnah Homs where they were surrounded by a contingent of up to 6000 antiAssad rebels a figure almost surely exaggerated Not wanting to die in vain for the ideals of the Syrian state Korotkov writes rather grandly the Russians jumped into their vehicles and began retreat Alexei Malyuta s bag was lost and fell into the hands of the regime s opponents And from there his ecstatic obituary was uploaded to the Kavkaz Center Six mercenaries were wounded in the melee two seriously But the mercenaries credited their escape and survival to a sandstorm that they say blinded the advancing jihadists The Russians returned first to an air base in Homs where they recalled a loud argument between Vadim Gusev and the Syrian employer of the Slavonic Corps It was clear that they had different views on the subsequent plan Everybody heard their yells including mentions of dollars and more specifically of 4 million that would have to be worked off In the event nothing was worked off and all 267 Russians drove back to the base camp in Latakia neither expecting a hero s welcome nor receiving one instead they were now scorned by the same crowd that had cheered them days earlier A risky but remunerative assignment that was the men were flown back to Moscow in the final days of October on two chartered planes But as they filed off the planes at Moscow s Vnukovo airport all the men were taken into temporary custody by waiting FSB agents who confiscated their SIM cards electronic media and passports and began interrogating them individually Gusev the head of the mission was arrested under Article 359 along with Evgeny Sidorov Moran s human resources head and a 20 percent owner of the company Both men now face as many as eight years in prison for recruiting mercenaries Galeotti told the Interpreter that given Moran President Vyacheslav Kalashnikov s background as an FSB reservist you never really retire from this status he and his private military company would have had frequent and dense contacts with the Russian security organs Someone within the government apparatus must have putkept Syria on the list of countries where they are clear to work and processed their request he said Andrei Soldatov another expert The Restoration of Russia s Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB agrees We can not exclude the possibility that Kalashnikov just used his contacts in the FSB to get some good contracts in Syria Soldatov said I mean it might be not that the FSB exploited him but that he exploited the FSB It s not hard to surmise why the FSB would have turned on a company it may have given tacit support to send men into Syria The mercenaries performed poorly in the field and proof of their illicit activity had been plastered all over the Internet so not tossing Gusev and Sidorov in the clink might have caused the kind of scandal that even an unembarrassable Kremlin would want to avoid Moscow has been outspoken in its criticism of US and Arab arms transfers to Syria s rebels even as its own state arms export company dispatches more and more sophisticated hardware to Assad according to the State Department s Robert Ford the US ambassador to Syria imperiled Geneva II peace conference takes place in December just in time for the regime to be in a much strengthened negotiating position after a series of tactical gains on the battlefield True Russia has nt been shy about showing support for Assad even after the regime deployed chemical weapons on Aug 21 something the Russian Foreign Ministry still denies Reuters reported recently that secondtier Russian banks have been taking Syrian regime deposits including barter accounts that would allow Damascus to import foodstuffs in exchange for oil or goods Russian military technicians have also been in Syria to train and advise regime personnel on the use of Russiansold airdefense systems At least one former GRU Russian military intelligence officer took a bullet in the face while claiming to have been vacationing in the war zone and moonlighting as a correspondent with proregime Abkhazian Network News Agency There were also rumors this past May that soldiers with the elite Zaslon Screen detachment of the Russian special forces were being sent to Syria assault But all this as the Kremlin loves to point out has been undertaken strictly in compliance with international law and with respect to Syria s state sovereignty But evidence of Russian citizens breaking Russian law to fight in Syria that s something that hardline Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would find hard to explain in one of his biggrinning palmslapping rap sessions with US Secretary of State John Kerry Complicating things even more for Russia is that Moran may have violated sanctions on Syria in the British Virgin Islands While Moran is technically registered in breezy seenoevil Belize it is 50 percent owned by an entity called Neova Holdings Ltd which is registered in the Caribbean territory a favored offshore corporate landing post for Russian enterprises trying to obfuscate their ownership structures In fact even Moran s domain name is registered to Neova Holdings The islands constitute a British overseas territory and as such they typically comply with British UN or EU sanctions regimes Indeed Services Commission announced that it was in full compliance with the European Union s sanctions and arms embargo on Syria and would give effect to an asset freeze in relation to persons responsible for the violent repression against the Syrian population in Syria persons and entities benefiting from or supporting the Assad regime An attempt by Foreign Policyto reach the office of the British Virgin Islands premier for comment was unsuccessful But regardless of what comes of the ongoing FSB investigation into Moran s weekendwarrior work in Russia its largest owner seems to have found itself on the wrong side of British Virgin Islands law Moran previously made international headlines way before its abbreviated adventurism in Homs In October 2012 one of its ships the MV Myre Seadiver was seized by the Nigerian Navy in Lagos where it had docked temporarily to change crews en route from Madagascar to Conakry Guinea Fifteen Russian sailors on board all of them comprising the new crew that had been replaced in port were arrested was not detained Myre Seadiver registered in the Cook Islands a territory legally bound to New Zealand but sailing under a Dutch flag had a maritime registration certificate dated June 2012 authorizing the ship to store carry and embarkdisembark arms amp ammunitions along with security teams It found was carrying 14 AK47s 22 Benelli MR1 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition for both according to the Nigerians who said that the vessel had no prior authorization to dock in the country or transport weapons Nigeria is a hub for global arms trafficking given its chronic problems with Islamist insurgents oil bandits and pirates It took until February 2013 for the sailors of Myre Seadiver to be granted bail which also came along with a 500000 demand for the release of the ship and remanded to the custody of the Russian ambassador in Lagos The sailors were returned to Russia this past October Yet one veteran Russia watcher John Helmer who has fault in this affair Moran has also cropped up in an unflattering light in a recent report by C4ADS a nonprofit security and analysis firm based in Washington DC The Odessa Network Mapping Facilitators of Russian and Ukrainian Arms Transfers written by C4ADS senior analyst Tom Wallace and Chief Operating Officer Farley Mesko notes that one of Moran s clients is the Germanowned Hansa Heavy Lift HHL the rebranded incarnation of Beluga Shipping a bankrupted company that was notorious for Russian and Ukrainian arms trafficking through Europe Two members of HHL s four managing directors are Beluga veterans Wallace and Mesko write and a high percentage of HHL s fleet is inherited from Beluga Beluga was responsible for shipments of AQ Khan centrifuges to Libya antitank missiles to Myanmar and tanks to South Sudan The exact nature of Moran s relationship with HHL or what kind of cargo they are hired to protect is unknown Illegally running Keystone Cossacks into Homs and contracting technology is nt exactly a winning corporate profile even in Vladimir Putin s Russia But Moran s humiliating moment at the hands of jihadists in Syria now confirmed by the Russian media comes at an especially sensitive time for Moscow which has lately been trying to host a meeting between Assad regime officials and representatives of the Westernbacked Syrian National Coalition in advance of Geneva II The Russian authorities are cracking down on these mercenaries because to not do so would compromise the image the Kremlin is trying to cultivate as a fair and neutral player in helping solve the Syria crisis said Donald Jensen a former US diplomat in Russia and now a resident fellow at Johns Hopkins University s Center for Transatlantic Relations Russia wants to be the country all parties to the conflict have to turn to rather than the United States A surefire way to scupper this selfappointed role as peace broker for a 19month civil war that has killed 115000 people and externally or internally displaced millions more is to get a shady private military company with ti es to Russian intelligence Steyn looking to shoulder victory at IGT Centurion In 2009 major surgery to repair ligament damage to his right

School to roll around again Since September Steyn has been playing the 12event IGT Race to QSchool series to prepare and ending in a tie for lead in the 10th event at Centurion Country Club on Monday

the other way The Regent College cabinet lowered tuition fees by 86 per cent through general consensus on October 18 with the new rates coming into effect May 1 2012 The decision to decrease tuition rates was not taken lightly said the Regent College director of marketing and communications Sarah Clayton We are acutely aware of the financial burden today s student is under We know that increasing tuition is not sustainable Regent College is an international graduate school of Christian studies located on UBC campus It is formally affiliated with UBC and all Regent students are members of the AMS According to Hannah Dutko VP External of the Regent College Student Association the tuition decrease is meant to increase enrolment Essentially it was just the motivation to decrease the to see people in those seats where there s good professors and classes We know that people want to come so what s holding them back is money she said The college also changed its tuition structure to reduce the costs for students who only study parttime Previously students taking less than 9 credits paid 495 per credit students taking less than 12 credits paid 480 per credit while fulltime students paid 445 per credit hour Now all students pay a flat rate of 440 per credit It helps people decide whether to take more classes based on the reality of their life not just whether it will be cheaper if they take this many more classes said Dutko But students were nt expecting any changes regarding their fees The students were all surprised by it Even though we all wanted lower tuition it was nt like we thought it was possible said Dutko I was sitting next to the student He did nt know anything about it American students are expected to benefit most from the tuition savings Students from the US make up almost onethird of the Regent College student body Dutko said that as the US dollar has decreased in value US enrolment has decreased at the same rate Firstyear Master of Divinity student Matt Sidell looks forward to the change and sees the college benefiting in the long run If you lower the cost of anything it actually makes people more excited about it and more likely to promote it I think it s a big deal Clarityfm Business advice from experts just a phone call away A Moncton NB entrepreneur who recently sold his Silicon Valleybased startup is set to launch another company this week On Jan 5 Dan Martell will unveil Clarityfm a webbased application that links budding entrepreneurs to advisors and experts before a crowd of 500 people at the Capitol Theatre in Moncton As Mr Martell explains it the service connects speakers with seekers Those speakers will include more than 350 of the world s best technology entrepreneurs and venture capitalists Real estate moguls marketers and bestselling authors are also on board he says Spanning from Silicon Valley to Boston New York and Canada users will be a phone call away from the advisor of their choice Once connected the advisor aids the entrepreneur and charges a fee for his or her time Clarity is the easiest way to get paid for your advice Mr Martell says adding fees Advisors can choose to donate their fee to charity in which case Clarity wo nt take a percentage Mr Martell says he hopes Clarity will generate 1million for charity in January alone He left Moncton for Silicon Valley in 2008 after selling Spheric Technologies Inc which developed social media applications for large companies such as Johnson amp Johnson and Procter amp Gamble Spheric Technologies which Mr Martell launched in 2004 with his life savings of 70000 it nearly went bankrupt in the first six weeks turned out to be the inspiration for Clarity In San Francisco he launched social media firm Flowtown with 750000 which he raised from big name investors including Mitch Kapor the founder of Lotus Software That company was bought this past October by San Franciscobased Demandforce for a figure in the millions As part of the buyout Mr Martell agreed to stay on at Demandforce for a full year He resigned in December to focus fully on Clarity I started now he says I decided this idea is too important Mr Martell is selffunding the venture with roughly 200000 Initially New Brunswickers will get first crack at the service says Mr Martell who is building a new house in Moncton and plans to live in the city half the year After the official launch Clarity will be available to anyone seeking entrepreneurial advice Many New Brunswickers including Gerry Pond the godfather of that province s tech sector are on Clarity s roster of experts How did Spheric spark the idea for Clarity Two years into the business when Mr Martell was completely lost he got some advice from an unlikely source I was clueless I did nt know what I was doing I did nt know if what I was building was interesting or a big waste of time he recalls Desperate he sent a cold email to former New Brunswick premier Frank McKenna McKenna now deputy chair of TD Bank Group directed Mr Martell to some of New Brunswick s top tech founders including Mr Pond Ken Nickerson and Ian Cavanagh Mr Martell still turns to them for advice Nothing will change an entrepreneur s life more than talking to a person who has done it successfully before he says A 10minute phone call can change a person s life But while the world of communications is undergoing a drastic digital change an affordable Canadian postal system is essential for the survival of many Canadian businesses particularly small entrepreneurs a clutch of local business owners say My business would not exist without the postal system because couriers are outrageously expensive said Becky Stone the coowner of the Hudson Que based Organic Quilt Company Her firm s two online stores ship to customers around the world and the firm also imports many of the supplies it uses in its creations from the United States Ms Stone said the brokerage fees charged by courier firms that ship across the US border are too steep for her homebased business to absorb leaving Canada Post her only option Canada Post charges an official customs fees that is a fraction of what the courier firms cost she said If she was forced to hike her prices to cover courier brokerage costs her items which sell from around 15 for quilt would be too expensive for her customers and her business model would no longer function Torontobased retail analyst John Williams expects the use of postal services in Canada will dramatically decrease in the near future The post office management has got to get used to it and face the facts and act accordingly he said adding that the US postal service is losing millions The US Postal Service said this month it would cut back on services and shut down more than 200 mail processing centres which would increase mail delivery times Annie Dubois the owner of the booming DringDring Inc which makes handpainted bicycle bells says cutbacks at Canada Post could be disastrous for her business My entire online business depends on the Canada Post service she said I ca nt depend on FedEx because the cost of shipping one bell is equal to the cost of the bell or more Ms Dubois had a huge surge in overseas orders this month Christmas gifts It was nonstop she said as customers in England bought hundreds of bells during the night from her website while she was sleeping It really went crazy Ms Dubois said she would nt have been able to afford to fill those orders without Canada Post She benefits from a shipping discount available from Canada Post to small entrepreneurs called the Venture 1 program when she sends small packages using standard international airmail delivery It s the cheapest way to ship internationally when I send a bell to Japan or Australia like I do every week she said Despite the challenges facing the Canadian postal service sector retail analyst Mr Williams acknowledged Canada Post still plays a vital role for small Canadian entrepreneurs I used to own a catalogue business and Canada Post was our lifeblood he said We could nt afford to ship by courier What to See at the Next Stage Theatre Festival Simon Bracken and Leah Doz in Tomasso s Party the first play from author Jules Lewis The holidays are over most of us are back at work and it s cold Really cold But before you strap on your sad hats and grumpy galoshes for good until the first sign of spring you should probably check out a play or two at the 2012 Next Stage Festival the annual winter companion to the Toronto Fringe Festival In its fifth year the NSF is presenting 10 shows from January 4 to 15 at the Factory Theatre There s something for everyone shows both familiar and brand new artists both upandcoming and iconic and themes ranging from the absurd to the political to the dramatic Not to mention a heated beer tent So get a taste of the summer in the coldest time of the year and catch a show at the Next Stage Festival Here are the Stranger or How to Recognize an InvertECCE HOMO THEATRE Ecce Homo s cabaret shows with their use of found text and the critical eyes they cast on polarizing figures such as Mother Teresa and Lady Gaga are always provocative but Loving the Stranger is perhaps artistic director Alistair Newton s most personal show of late Poignantly the central figure in the play s story Montreal artist and designer Peter Flinsch passed away on the same day the show had its first public workshop the show had its full debut at the 2010 SummerWorks Festival Flinsch was arrested for kissing a Nazi officer at a party in 1942 and Newton who learned about Flinsch while in Germany researching midcentury antigay laws was the last person to interview Flinsch before his death Since the first run of Loving Newton has updated the show which also encompasses California s gay marriage debates Steve Fisher Tomasso s PartyROOFTOP CREATIONS This premiere embodies the festival s blend of emerging and established theatrical talents witty dialogue in his 2010 novel Waiting For Ricky Tantrum but makes his scriptwriting debut with Tomasso s Party which revolves around a romantic relationship choked with anxieties and quirks The participants in said relationship are also relatively new to Toronto s theatre scene both Simon Bracken and Leah Doz are recent grads of the esteemed National Theatre School in Montreal But a name definitely worthy of dropping is Dora Awardwinning actor Nigel Shawn Williams who takes directorial reigns on this show on the heels of rave reviews over his performance in TopdogUnderdog he also directed last year s acclaimed Brothel 9 Together this team makes for one of the festival s most exciting shows Carly Maga The Next Stage Festival features a few crowd favourites from the previous year s Fringe Festival including a few of our own too but perhaps the most welcome return is the sketch troupe Uncalled For with their wacky journey through the mental limbo between consciousness and sleep Hypnogogic Logic Unbounded by rationality and and concepts in a manner that somehow earns the latter half of the title Though Toronto audiences have been able to catch Uncalled For since we re looking forward to seeing this Best of Fringe Uptown choice on stage again In fact we re practically snoring in anticipation Carly Maga Amy Lee amp Heather Marie Annis Morro and Jasp clown characters new show Go Bake Yourself is in the new Antechamber series at the Next Stage Festival Photo by Alex Nirta Next Stage is trying something a little different this year programming two shows into the Factory Theatre s cozy upstairs bar as part of their inaugural Antechamber series Happily both shows are easy recommendations for us Love is a Poverty You Can Sellwas a hit of the 2010 Fringe Festival and the 2012 edition is a condensed version of the Kurt Weill cabaret with a smaller orchestra but many of the delightful numbers are intact including Christian Jefferies two very different torch songs between MC s Hans and Jodel Ryan Anning and Scott Dermody The other Antechamber presentation is a new clown show from Morro and Jasp who ve been one of the most popular clown acts on the Fringe circuit heck in Toronto altogether in recent years For Go Bake Yourself the two bickering sisters have very different ideas of what sort of cooking show they want to star in an intense Iron Chefstyle competition or a Julia Childstyle lovein Steve Fisher Looking towards this summer s upcoming Fringe Festival expectations are high for this year s New Play Contest winner Kat Sandler and her play Help Yourself Last year s winner Ins Choi s Kim s Convenience was a runaway hit and will be remounted by Soulpepper Theatre In the meantime the Next Stage Festival is offering a

forward to getting a glimpse of how the team has grown in their first year of operation and an idea of where they re going next Carly Maga CORRECTION January 3 500 PM We original wrote that Loving the Stranger premiered at the Fringe Festival in fact it was at the SummerWorks Festival Bangalore A lack of iron ore cargo due to Karnataka s ban on exporting the steelmaking commodity has led to the termination of a Rs 277 crore iron ore loading facility project at the New Mangalore port The facility was to be developed by Sical Logistics Ltd The trust that runs the Union governmentcontrolled New Mangalore port on Monday decided to terminate the project after Sical Logistics applied for force majeure citing the export ban for not beginning work on the project that was awarded in 2009 said two members of the port s board of trustees Companies can declare force majeure when they want to break contracts due to unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters fires or political events Sical Logistics had signed a concession agreement with the New Mangalore port in October 2009 to develop and operate a 662 million tonnes mt a year iron ore loading facility at the port for 30 years It won the contract after agreeing to share 37 of its annual revenue from the facility with the ore export has been banned by Karnataka The ball is in the Supreme Court which has set up an empowered committee to look into the legality or illegality of mining in the state Nobody knows when the court will give its final verdict GG Mohandas Prabhu a member of the board of trustees of the New Mangalore port said after the Monday meeting We can not wait indefinitely and it is not going to help neither the port nor Sical Mint could not independently verify what the port proposes to do with the bank guarantee of Rs 13 crore submitted by Sical A decision on recovery of the dues etc from Sical has been left to the port chairman said K Tharanath Shetty another member of the port s board of trustees Sical could not be reached for comment immediately A spokesman for the New Mangalore port declined to comment ahead of an official announcement On Sunday New Mangalore port chairman P Tamilvanan said the port force majeure TSN Murthy deputy chairman of the port said the port had received legal opinion on the issue that said both the parties should decide the future of the project mutually Sical had not spent a penny on the project he said adding the port can use the backup area and the berth for loading other cargo Sical s Rs 500 crore iron ore loading facility at Ennore port has been idling since it was opened in January 2011 for want of iron ore From 26 July 2010 Karnataka banned exports of iron ore from the state in a bid to curb rampant illegal mining in the mineralrich BellaryHospet belt Karnataka is the second largest producer of iron ore in the country and the ban has resulted in a significant decline in Indian ore exports The ban clipped iron ore loaded by New Mangalore port by half to 374 mt in the year to March 2011 from 706 mt in the previous year Between April and November the port loaded in the yearago period What does Ferguson have planned for Scholes In many ways it was the perfect Alex Ferguson ploy Clever sly swift and surprising The return of Paul Scholes in a Manchester derby will be something which will be told as a tale when current Manchester United fans pass on their passion to those who are yet to come and to those who are floating in the limbo of being a neutral fan In English football you never remain a neutral you take sides and get recruited Scholes comeback could be one such event or it could just be one massive failure to squeeze out whatever talent the redheaded man has left in him along with a stamina that he has kept warm due to his coaching indulgence Of course the argument of whether Sir Alex should really have recalled the former talisman or not flared up as soon as he lost the ball eventually resulting in the cross that allowed Sergio Aguero to slip one under Anders Lindegaard suddenly turned the colour of United s kit at 32 And the obvious question is is Ferguson s move justified But the more interesting one is what exactly made Scholes return Usually headstrong in his decisions and unwavering in his commitment towards himself and his family there must be something that made him cross his own path With Scholes being one of the most mediashy player to ever play in the Premier League this move has nothing to do with gaining attention In fact if there was one thing which must have stood between him and his manager s wish then it is his likeness for keeping out of the limelight The silent predator Even in the interview after his retirement he was scarily quiet and composed in his answers apart from a minor twitch he displays when he dislikes any question When he was asked how he felt when Xavi and Zidane praised him for his midfield prowess all he said was Yea it feels nice was barely caught on the microphone Considering all this there is certainly something he sensed at Old Trafford And this must have been pretty grave because the Scot could have easily picked Paul Pogba or Darren Gibson or more importantly just buy someone But he goes for this 37yearold man who admitted that one of the reasons for retirement was a realisation that he was nt contributing enough to the team He had receded into a deeper role over the last couple of years and United fans need to stop dreaming that he is here to score goals and win matches The more realistic expectation would be to see him come in the last 1520 minutes and prevent them from throwing away the match in the abrasive manner they have been in against Newcastle Blackburn and more importantly FC Basel In football terms he will play the role of the anchorman reliving at times what people say about him When Scholes has the ball the match seems to pause to incite a change in his midfielders attitudes With Scholes around no one is guaranteed a place More competition better training better performance on the field Or maybe he has suddenly found the keys to his everlocked jaws and is uttering some words which can encourage the youngsters into doing better With Fergie 70 now and wellknown for his flamboyant manner in which he treats the players they need someone to talk to A sort of a buffer between players and manager That would be perfect but just does nt seem to fit the personality profile of Scholes The wildest thought would be grooming him for the future After coaching getting into manmanagement is the next step With not more than five years left in Ferguson s tenure this is the ideal moment to groom someone from the midst Someone who has been there done that Imagining Scholes standing on the touchline jumping up and down Long shot but football is as unpredictable as it gets theories to be concretely answered and maybe this article will have the same theme come the end of May just a different headline and either lines of effusive praise or sullen criticism Maybe something on the lines of Scholes screamer takes United to the top of the table United fans must have hardly celebrated after the final whistle of the derby It was more of a sigh of relief the kind when a man finally feels land under him after a stormy ride in the ocean Core of the problem is that one pass which is lacking for the Red Devils That one pass which wrongfoots the best defender allowing the poaching talent of Javier Hernandez Danny Welbeck and Dimitar Berbatov flourish And to execute that one lethal touch there are few as good as Paul Scholes Even when the ball was laid up for him in the derby you could see in that one fleeting second that Scholes has lost none of his old touch The perfect body shape the the manner which has seen it rip the net out on so many occasions was proof enough that it does nt take a mere six months to lose your touch Form is temporary class is permanent Similarly you could argue how does six months change a man so much This move is also in plain terms a slap on the face of Anderson The Brazilian midfielder was given a good run in the squad last winter and managed to establish himself with a string of fair performances for his team But his return has seen him being used very carefully with a certain caution to not elevate him to the status of primary playmaker at Old Trafford The return of Tom Cleverley is what United fans want the most and with him being mentioned by the gaffer as their best performer in the initial part of the season there is no way he will rush in the Englishman That leaves Paul Scholes to fill in the gaps The question hovering over as a follower of the game one must enjoy it Just as we savour every sip of a mature wine with its taste bonded in time we must savour every touch of a genius Time past and time present Poornima Dasharathi travels to Anegondi and is fascinated by the juxtaposition of the past and the present She also meets the raja of Anegondi and the rani of Hampi As I stepped out of the Gangavati bus stand to catch an auto the morning sun was shining bright I was to go to Anegondi a small village facing Hampi across the Tungabhadra One can reach the place either by way of a coracle ride from Hampi or a rickshaw ride from Gangavati which is the first major town beyond the village Buses ply regularly to Hospet and Gangavati from Bangalore As one travels on the small winding road there s not much to see except the laidback smalltown scenes The first hint that Anegondi promises much more came literally at its gates the beauty of the fort gate structures and the walls still intact took my breath away The village is surrounded by huge boulders in the north and and east The village has a number of forts surrounding it and many defensive gateways which indicate that the village must once have been an important city As our auto moved along I entered the village through three grand gates one after another Kade bagilu Sunkada Bagilu Wannagasi making me wish that I could time travel to an era where the pace of life was slower and the town more prosperous In her book on Anegondi anthropologist Natalie Tobert explains that the village was an important administrative centre for the surrounding districts and the architectural remains can be dated from between the period of 12th and 13th centuries to the present day As I entered the village I could see children playing in the ground near Gagan Mahal a few shops that included an ATM leading to the main square the main road facing the centuriesold Ranganatha temple A huge wooden temple chariot stood nonchalantly in the centre of the fork its wheel acting as a backrest for some street vendors shop managed by the local community Unlike Hampi the village has a thriving community and the juxtaposition of the old with the new is surreal As I wandered around its streets watching children playing in centuriesold structures or cows grazing near the derelict fort walls I marvelled at this peaceful coexistence History Anegondi is much older than Hampi The inscription near the main square states that its history dates back to the third century BC during Asoka s reign though much of the relics that I saw could be placed between 12th and 17th centuries When Vijayanagara was founded in middle of the 14th century Anegondi was already a wellestablished town It was ruled by Malik Naib a Muslim representative of Delhi s Sultan Mohammed Tughlaq Hakka and Bukka conquered this town and ruled from here originally the capital was later transferred to Hampi as the kingdom expanded Anegondi has been attacked many times but somehow has survived even after the devastating Talikota battle of 1565 Today it is the seat Vijayanagara Mythologically Anegondi has always been identified with Kishkinda the land of Vali Sugreeva and Anjaneya Places to see Ranganatha temple The main temple against a rocky backdrop is home to some beautiful Vijayanagara and Chalukya pillars though it looks like they have been reused or reinstalled in an effort to conserve Gagan Mahal Facing the temple is this small structure with frescoes and looks like a place for the royal women to enjoy the city scenes without being seen Lotus Mahal On a road off the main road is this Mahal in a dilapidated condition It once housed the

payment the gang had taken the original certificates of the candidates he added Toyota Prius camper conversion unveiled at Tokyo Auto Salon Ever wanted to go camping but always thought campervans consumed too much fuel A camper conversion for the Toyota Prius could be your answer Looking a little like a giant telephone handle stuck onto the top of a Prius or even a Smurf if you owned a blue Prius the camper conversion was unveiled at the 2012 Tokyo Auto Salon in Japan over the weekend It s a custom obviously creation developed by a camping specialist called Campinn The company starts out by cutting rear sections of the Prius out and adapting a special fibrereinforced plastic mould over the top The large mould conceals a door entrance at the rear with its own roller blind and two beds one of which sits on top of the roof and another that takes place of where the rear seats and boot space used to be Campinn says there s also an optional flipout coffee table and sofa that can be added exterior comes with Prius taillights which have been grafted into the custom mould The large camper section adds 520mm to the Prius overall length 4460mm in standard form and 560mm to the overall height 1490mm in standard form We re not sure how much weight this conversion adds to the back of the rather sorrylooking Prius but it would likely put additional loads onto the Prius s hybrid powertrain SOCIAL SHARE ugly as it can be home this conversion flies away at the speed of 30kmh Johnny Well that s rather different Labryz What The Hell That thing is messed upAlthough the comment about it looking like a smurf is vastly amusing and would be tempted to buy just for that reason 3D4 I wonder how this house on the top of otherwise perfectly aerodynamic car affects the fuel consumption performance and the drive generaly Must be fun Sam Looks like a mobile porta loo greener better Chucky Well if I am retired and just want to travel around australia on a sealed and flat unsealed road I do nt mind this Just wonder if they have any option on larger fuel tank Tony lol why garl i ll have the camper part in black so i can call it elvis Al This looks hideous Although I can understand the appeal of a hybrid car for camping as you can leave the AC or fan on all night running on battery with the engine turning on occasionally to keep the battery charged You can also power small applianceselectrical items from the battery for reasonable time But somehow I doubt this offers much more room than a Prius V wagon with its rear seats folded Force15 It s eating the Prius lol

Real Estate Subscribe Now RESEARCH published this month shows children raised in planned lesbian families are doing just fine The research is part of a breakthrough longitudinal study being conducted in the US which has followed children being raised by lesbians since the 1980s This research along with other recently published papers show that children from planned lesbian families are doing at least as well as and sometimes better than children from heterosexual families The research comes as no surprise to Lismore mother Christine Minkov who with her partner Kate Willock is raising two children Daniel 8 and Alice 5 She said that in lesbian relationships pregnancies never happened by mistake and this meant the parents had time to think and plan for their children I do nt think there is a onesizefitsall way of being a parent Ms Minkov said However successful parenting was about love and commitment to the process sexuality she said Kate and I are very aware that many people are critical of same sex couples having children and knowing this has made us more committed to building resilience in our children We know they will be teased at some point in their lives so we try to prepare them for that to stand strong know they are loved and be just what they are beautiful children who have two mums Her children had already experienced negative comments made by other children but had dealt with it well she said Ms Minkov said that while there had been a shift in community attitudes toward gay and lesbian families there was still much discrimination particularly toward the nonbiological mother The research published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioural Pediatrics this month shows that children from lesbian homes have a quality of life which is equal to children from heterosexual homes Another study on psychological adjustment conducted by the National Longitudinal Family Study found children from academic areas All the studies can be downloaded from

but admits its future beyond that is less clear Chrysler Group Australia CGA managing director Clyde Campbell says the company is not currently considering dropping the Dodge brand from its local lineup despite the fact the sevenseat Journey will be the flying the flag on its own for much of the year The compact Nitro SUV and the Caliber hatchback have both been discontinued We re pretty confident that Dodge is here for all of this year Campbell says although he admits it could be a different story in 12 months time We re in a dynamic game who knows what we ll be saying this time next year Campbell says he is confident Dodge will sell more than 2000 units of the recently updated Journey in Australia this year a result he says would make financial sense for the company Dodge Journeys in 2011 Dodge works for us as a brand There s a lot of brands in this marketplace that would love to have a brand that sold 2000 units a year So we re not looking to drop that Dodge unless we can find something that was going to give us a lot bigger return for our money Dodge is a pretty important thing for us going forward FiatChrysler global boss Sergio Marchionne and Jeep CEO Mike Manly told reporters at last week s Detroit motor show that a restructuring of his group s brands in Australia would take place within the next three months The restructuring could see the distribution responsibilities of some or all of the FiatChrysler brands currently distributed by Ateco Automotive Abarth Alfa Romeo and Fiat and European Automotive Imports Ferrari and Maserati shift to CGA CGA has brand responsibility for all eight brands as well as Lancia not sold in Australia despite currently being operationally responsible for just three has been in regular discussion with Ateco Automotive owner Neville Crichton and managing director Ric Hull about ways to further the performance of the brands under their control There have been discussions about whether it would be better under us but at this stage there is no agreement to do anything concretely Campbell said the multiple distributor setup was typical of a number of FiatChrysler markets around the world Ateco are pretty good at what they do They ve demonstrated that for a number of years with a number of different brands Regardless Campbell says he believes CGA has the capacity to manage the distribution of all eight brands if that is the desire of Marchionne and the overseas parent company We think we do Campbell says We currently manage three brands We did nt have any Chrysler availability last year but with the two brands where we did have available product we think we did a reasonable job We started moving in the right direction our way If the powers that be want us to look in a different direction then we ll follow that and see where it goes Campbell said CGA had not done enough analysis to know what structure was in the company s best interests yet and insisted a changeover of distribution rights would only take place if it was mutually agreeable You would nt do it just for the sake of doing it you d have to do it because you saw benefits to both brands If there s not clearly benefits both ways then you do nt do it You do nt take it to build power and end up averaging down two brands You do it if it s going to build both brands At this stage I m trying to keep our team focused on the job that s definitely in front of us and that job really is about Jeep and Chrysler and Dodge this year We would nt want to take too much of a bite if SOCIAL SHARE Campbell is obviously sucking up to Ateco by saying they re good at what they do they re the opposite Ateco chopped and changed Fiats range every 2 weeks discontinued the Ritmo AND the Punto just when sales started picking up They never imported a semiauto Ritmo despite availability in other RHD markets They ve screwed with Alfa for years and do nt market any of their brands Fiat could potentially sell very well in Australia as they do small cars very well IMO Fiat should drop Dodge from Aus and focus on Fiat itself They should bring back the full 500 range not just a 14 Sport model the Punto range the Ritmo and possibly introduce the Linea Panda the soon to be announced Ellezero crossover and the Freemont rebadged Dodge Journey And sell them through current Fiat dealerships plus Dodge dealers without Ateco Tlaxcala Actually I think Dodge s full line up Dart upcoming Avenger replacement Charger Challenger Journey than its Voyager sibling has more potential in Australia on the whole than Fiat s does it would be a mistake to drop Dodge from Australia instead of expanding it but no reason they also ca nt concerntrate on Fiat as a Niche brand Al That would work but if Fiat then dropped Chrysler and Jeep from aus The Charger overlaps the 300c while Durango and Journey would overlap Jeep s products The Avenger replacement would also then overlap the Chrysler 200 if released in Aus Although a full Dodge model line with predominantly large cars nothing smaller than the Dart plus a full Fiat line up with small cars only would work well for Aus as they would have pretty much every segment covered Tlaxcala Some overlap will always occur when there are multiple brands on sale it even occurs within single brands and the products are different enough that they wo nt cannablize each other s sales Some consumers will like the 300 but not assume discontuning the 300 in the Australian market would be of benefit to Dodge and so on with the other similar models Also keep in mind some households shop between similar cars and get two of them I d get a new Challenger for me and a 300 for the wife if I could afford them p Pal I agree and in fact if we got the full Dodge lineup I have no Doubt Dodge would be the the top selling out of all Fiat and Chrysler brands even over Jeep Showtime Dodge needs to bring the Charger Challenger and Dart here if they want continued success and brand awareness I do nt know why they have nt done this yet Tim Its their loss they have no right to wonder why their sales are so low in Australia they do nt bother selling their best vehicles here they need to get their act together if Chrysler Corp wants to be a global automaker Peanut Ditto Bring the Charger fix Airtrek02 I see no problem in FiatAlfaAbarth being sold under the Chrysler Group in fact I think it would be an excellent idea These three brands need a stronger company to import them and with the backing of Fiat Group this is certainly it As well as a stronger backing they need new product and they need it now Fiat needs the Panda the Punto Evo the whole 500 range and the Ritmo back and surely Mazda will let them have Bravo back as a name Alfa needs more of an enginetransmission range as well as a price drop and Abarth needs the Punto ASAP Dodge needs the Dart desperately it s based on the Giulietta platform how is it not RHD convertable but the Charger would be a great addition it s the car I always hoped they d release here and they still have nt as well as the Durango Chrysler well all they need is the new 300C and that s but keep the Ypsilon There s light at the end of the tunnel but it will take a lot of effort from them that s for sure I wish them luck As for Ateco being good at what they do I d say that s so unbelievably false that it is nt funny Their car brands barely sell 2000 a year combined lol in Australia and that s chiefly because their pricing is absolutely sky high Citroen need to set up a proper distributor for Australia because their product range needs a shuffle too Would love to see both Charger amp Challenger sold in Aus Especially Charger Great addition to V8 Supercars COTF series next year Kensands79 Active Member 5 posts Sergio Marchionne Do nt drop the Dodge brand in Australia and replace it with FiatI bought a Dodge Journey near new early last year which I purchased because it was American as I was bored with Japanese cars I wanted something differentThe car is was badged as a Fiat Freemont there would be no way that I would have bought itAustralian s do NOT BUY OR LIKE FIAT CARS they have long memories of past Fiats The reason Dodge has not sold very well over the last sIx years has a lot more to do with the poor marketing and promotion of the products than the cars themselvesGive DODGE another chance by promoting and pricing the products better and give us the NEW DODGE DARTAustralians love Jeeps and would love well built and priced American made and branded product DODGES and CHRYSLERS As for Ateco they derserve to lose the distribution of your bands as they have always been a hopeless at marketing your products Thank you Mkstrat I agree keep dodge and bring in the muscle cars Aussies love them and would be fresh air to the V8 super car series that s getting boring The marketing done with Jeep recently has been great it made me checkout the new grand cherokee and I ordered one I really should not give up on Dodge bring in what people want and it will pay off Simmog Instead of selling the boxes on wheels why not the Challenger range for the rhd markets I am sure NZ and UK would go for it as well The SUV market is saturated and they try and tap into it yet the retro real yankee muscle car market is untapped Stop listening to the marketing guys and find out

salivating but the cured airdried beef snack is not an easy product to introduce to a new market Canterbury Biltong director David Stanley said selling his product was difficult initially It was very difficult in the beginning because 80 per cent of people did nt know whether it was wood or bark or eel Biltong is cured spiced beef which is airdried It is not the same as beef jerky which is cut into thin strips marinated and then cooked or smoked The biltongmaking business started off as an afterhours sideline but when it grew beyond that Stanley left his day job and went into biltong manufacturing full time After a couple of years it grew so busy he persuaded his wife Nicole to join him Stanley travelled New Zealand to raise awareness of the product taking part in food shows and food markets to get the Canterbury Biltong brand well and the September 4 quake only required a twoweek closure for a cleanup Initially they and their landlord had thought the building was repairable but with repeated aftershocks and uncertainty over the zoning of the land it became apparent it would be a long time before the business would get back into its original premises if at all Canterbury Biltong did not have business interruption insurance My broker had sent me a reminder the week before saying it would be a very good idea Stanley said But a table of costs and benefits that should have been attached to the letter was missing so Stanley had put it aside in his todo pile After the quake I rushed upstairs to get the server and documents and recipes The letter from my broker was sitting on the floor I could see it The business made use of the Government s wage subsidy which had been fantastic They survived on savings and their material damage and contents took a long time to come through but did eventually In August Stanley approached Recover Canterbury for help The organisation helped Canterbury Biltong apply for a grant from the Canterbury Business Recovery Trust and the business received a 25000 grant from the trust which helped offset the costs of relocating to its new Phillipstown premises As a food producer it had been very difficult to find appropriate new premises that complied with the necessary hygiene standards but eventually it reopened in its new Phillipstown premises in September Surviving until then had been really difficult because they could not make or sell any product Rent at the new premises is double what it was at the Ferry Rd site but the new factory is export standard with room to grow and the business is hoping to export its first shipment to Australia this year At the time of the quake Canterbury Biltong was in negotiations with a distribution company and the distributor has not abandoned them The company has just around New

the Xray on Facebook during his ambulance ride between hospitals for surgery AP PhotoChrist Medical Center amp Hope Children s Hospital Gail Glaenzer still ca nt believe that her fianc unknowingly shot a nail into his skull let alone that he posted a picture of the Xray on Facebook during his ambulance ride between hospitals for surgery But she was joking about the circumstances Friday a day after doctors successfully removed the 3 inch nail from Dante Autullo s brain Dante says I want it to make a necklace out of it Glaenzer said Glaenzer sat on Friday in the lobby of Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn Illinois where Autullo 32 of Orland Park was listed in fair condition in the hospital s intensive care unit She was still trying to process just He feels good He moved all his limbs he s talking normal he remembers everything said Glaenzer 33 It s amazing a miracle Autullo was in his workshop using the nail gun on Tuesday when it recoiled near his head Glaenzer said He felt what he thought was the point of the gun hit his head But what really happened was that when the gun came in contact with his head the sensor recognized a flat surface and fired she said I looked at it when he got home and it just looked like his head was cut open she said With nothing to indicate that a nail had not simply whizzed by his ear as Autullo explained to her she cleaned it with peroxide While there are painsensitive nerves on a person s skull there are nt any within the brain itself That s why he would have felt the nail strike penetrate the brain Neither thought much about it and Autullo went on with his day even plowing a bit of snow But the next day when he awoke from a nap feeling nauseated Glaenzer sensed something was wrong and suggested they go to the hospital At first Autullo refused but he relented after the two picked up their son at school Wednesday evening A couple hours later an Xray was taken and there in the middle of his brain was a nail Doctors told Autullo and Glaenzer that the nail came within millimeters from the part of the brain that controls motor function He was rushed by ambulance to the other hospital for more specialized care Hospital spokesman Mike Maggio said the surgery took two hours and the part of the skull that was removed for surgery was replaced with a titanium mesh The surgeon did nt want to put that part of the skull back in place fearing it might have been contaminated by the nail he said about how scared he was about what might have happened he did express a recognition about coming close to death He was joking with me after surgery We need to get the Discovery Channel up here to tape this she recalled him saying I m one of those medical miracles Soldierlecturer invited to study US security Relevant offers A soldier and Massey University lecturer is off to the United States to take part in a course examining US national security policy and current threats facing the country Major Josh Wineera was the only New Zealander invited to the programme by the US State Department Major Wineera said he felt humbled to be representing New Zealand the Defence Force and Massey University s Centre for Defence and Security Studies This will be an excellent opportunity to deepen our understanding of the way the US formulates its national security policy he said The postgraduate level programme begins later this month in Amherst Massachusetts and involved about 20 participants from around the world It includes sessions at Harvard University and visits to the University of California in San Diego and Washington DC The sixweek programme will examine such issues as energy policy economic stability cybersecurity chemical and biological weapons nuclear weapons and infectious diseases The addition to lecturing at Massey University Major Wineera speaks to many Defence Force contingents preparing for overseas deployments particularly to Afghanistan His operational experience included missions to Bosnia Bougainville East Timor and more recently Iraq He was also a member of the New Zealand forum of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific 2012 will be a big year for me Major Wineera said I start with this incredible invitation to deepen my understanding of US national security policy and it will continue as I embark on a PhD By total coincidence my doctorate will examine New Zealand s approach to international security and will compare it to other nations including the US Double the fun at Friendly Bay event Daniel OBrien won the best dressed award and the trophy for best overall birdman last year Photo by Peter McIntosh Waitangi Day at the beach is the appeal of the Oamaru Harbour regatta and birdman competition to be held this year on February 6 Both competitions are staged annually but this year a coordinated approach is being taken to attract people to Friendly Bay at Oamaru Harbour Ultimately I would love to see lots of families down at Friendly Bay with their picnic rugs chilly bins frisbees and rugby balls really enjoying the day Waitaki event development officer Jan Kennedy said As well as the opening of Signal Hut the harbour regatta and the birdman competition visitors to Friendly Bay would be entertained with live music including Johnny and the Cashtones Gatling Fun Jef Mitchell and Kit McGregor Children s activities and food beverage and coffee vendors would also be on offer of the events planned for the regatta included Seagull outboard motor races rowing races sailing dinghy races bathing beauties men and women in traditional and retro costumes and sand castle building Traditional and classic boats would be on the water as well as on display There would also be a display of coracle seamanship The Scott s Own Sea Scouts would also be on the water in their sailing cutters The regatta is organised by the Friendly Bay Boat Society which is based at the Tyne Street Boatshed The birdman competition in which competitors throw themselves off a ramp on Holmes Wharf is organised by Port FM and in the past has been staged on a different day from the boat regatta This year the two will be held on the same day to boost the fun It seems logical that with all of the individual events that are happening on this special day that we should look at a coordinated marketing approach Ghost Recon Future Soldier preview the science of war The future of warfare is closer than you think as GameCentral goes handson with the new Ghost Recon and its high tech military gadgetry Ghost Recon Future Soldier war never changes Have you ever noticed how modern scifi games and movies never seem to feature ray guns or other more advanced technologies anymore Rapid space flight is still commonplace but in an attempt to create a kind of grounded realism even games like Halo and Mass Effect are filled with machineguns and other almost contemporary technology The peculiar upshot of this is that the Ghost Recon series which has always tried to accurately simulate the near future of infantry combat now seems more scifi than actual scifi games But everything in the new Future Soldier game is based on technologies that are either just about to be deployed or are at least under development We got to play short sections of five different levels all featuring your fourman squad be Russian soldiers we ve no idea yet what the story is behind the game except that it references Shadow Wars on the 3DS which presumably means robot drones at some point Squad controls have fallen out of fashion in recent years so even though Future Soldier doesn t necessarily do anything new with them it s good simply to see them back The third person controls are standard for the genre and although you can direct teammates to move to specific spots or take out specific enemies they ll conduct themselves perfectly well on their own They will always follow your lead though and wo nt start a firefight without you This leads to many moments where you set up a synchshot attack where each team member is locked onto an enemy their blue laser sighting only waiting for your order to send a bullet whizzing along its trajectory One of the main new technological gimmicks for Future Soldier is optical camo These are nt quite invisibility cloaks unseen even when right next to an enemy as long as you are nt moving The faster you go the less useful they are but those who always favour a stealth approach will love them The obvious concern with this sort of high tech equipment especially when most of your enemies are just AK47 wielding terrorists is that it makes the game too easy That s certainly not the case from what we ve seen though not least because you re almost always outnumbered But there s also an interesting suppression mechanic where the camera wobbles wildly when you re under heavy weapons fire to mimic the confusion and panic you d feel if it was really happening It s not a concept we ve seen since the Brothers In Arms games and struggling to call in your team to take out your attacker really does induce a genuine sense of panic Although if you do get hit there s a relatively generous bleed out time limit that allows your team to came and find and revive you ve got what amounts to xray vision through your headsup display crosscom eye piece You ve a little flying drone that you can deploy whenever you want to scout the area which will even target enemies for the rest of the team Or if enemies are closer by you can throw a sensor grenade which will instantly add anyone with a gun to your list of targets It s all made to look very plausible and as you can see from our interview with one of the team most of the tech is either already in action or relatively imminent We even happened across this story on the BBC today which illustrates the current real world progress with optical camo As interesting and novel as all this is though it does nt automatically make for a great game although there are some other interesting ideas beyond the gadgets Civilians are much more prominent and numerous than in other similar games and they can easily tip off enemies as to your presence Creeping through have been simply because we did nt know when a civilian might call out to the guards if they saw us or when they might stampede in panic when the fighting started One level set on a busy street in Pakistan almost seemed like a riff on Heat with abandoned cars everywhere as you methodically work your way up towards your target This was the most exciting and distinctive level although a more stealthbased one in a Russian forest was also interesting Especially in terms of the amount of freedom it gave you in the route you took through it and how stealthy you were about it We enjoyed the demo but there were definitely concerns The four soldiers making up your team had no discernable personality or even distinguishing features and we re not convinced from our interview that this will necessarily change in the final game This might not be a serious flaw but it does seem a missed opportunity give the focus on how they all work together A more obvious issue which genuinely did look PlayStation 2 quality in places This we were assured would change in the final game and given that the rest of the visuals look fine we re willing to believe that for now We certainly hope the game turns out well because we need more realistic science fiction games and although that was probably never the role Ghost Recon was trying to fill it does so very well anywayFormats Xbox 360 PlayStation

victimhood are equally bullying For example the miserable sacrificing widowed sewingmachine wielding TB stricken mother of old Hindi movies who controlled outcomes of when her sons and daughters would eat and who they could go out with DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR PSYCHE Numerous examples come to mind when I think female bullies and the diverse ways in which women misuse this force It makes me wonder if women have swung from inhabiting one stereotype to another Has the doormat woman in her search for the self transformed into the vicious bully Or is it that she always existed as an exaggerated expression of self to do what it takes to achieve what she wants Pooja Misrra was quick to follow Bindra s suit in the recently concluded season and became the new female bully the woman who intimidates people to get her way with them Deeply implanted in the psyche of Indian society are the timeless energies of Mahabharata and Ramayana which also include Kaikayi as a key player in the form of the Machiavellian wife who used all she had including boons of gratitude to twist things in her favour Is there a female bully in your home Is there one in you When I asked people this question they had no stories to tell about themselves or bosses wives sisters making me wonder if this was a secret that no one wanted to talk about Is it because the men do nt want to admit that the women boss them around As for the women is it that they do nt want to accept that the one they call a Bitch laughingly or away to A LEGACY OF BULLYING As an older sister of three brothers I grew up bossing them When I could not win with words I beat them physically until they outgrew me physically Yes I am an erstwhile bully As a little girl I had figured out what made my whole world tick Being witty got me what I needed from dad even if it meant going against my mother s wishes Jealous of my younger angeliclooking brother I made it my life s agenda to make him pay for being born The easiest way to do that was to become the focus of everyone s attention and throw into the mix hitting pinching tale telling As I got older I learned to use ignoring and viciousness as my tools I was a bullying girl without realising it I schemed calculated and manipulated to get what I wanted no matter what Today I look back on my life journey a marriage motherhood of most of my relationships have been skewed Two thirds of my life has been about aggression either dishing it out or receiving it I would either bully or be bullied I was helpless in the clutches of this need within me for extreme expressions of anger WORKING IT OUT Psychologists say that at the core of every bully is a fearful child Bullying can only stop when we are ready to acknowledge our power ignore the fearful child and confront the bully in ourselves and her dynamicshow she creeps up on her when we insist on our way directly or insidiously Also what do we as women or as victims of female bullying toward us and toward men want to do about it What are our options when we come face to face with the bullying woman Do we quietly go along with whatever she wants or ignore her and do what is ok by us The answers are different for each of us Every individual age 50 I am pleased to say that I have worked that bully out of my system I have grown up I no longer have any need to abuse my power or give it away to anyone else These healing years have however been tinged with remorse at my past behaviour When my brother jokes with me and says We are scared for life I am reminded that as his bullying older sister I must have something to do with his childhood perceptions of how harsh the world is Would this perception not have impacted his life and his relationships Has he been in other relationships where the dynamics have been the same where he has felt helpless in the face of overt or subtle domineering Only he knows the answer Your little princess may be a bully after all She may not shout throw tantrums or come home with torn clothes like her brother But this does nt mean that your little princess ca nt knock someone down especially common among girls at all female institutions Bullying is generally considered a manly trait and girls bully each other less in coed schools as they are keen to show their feminine qualities School counsellors and educators say that bullying is especially common among girls at all female institutions Female bullying is mostly verbal mocking at their classmates clothes height complexion and weight for instance Girls who do nt get their eyebrows plucked hands and legs waxed or who prefer knee length socks over ankle length ones are the easy targets CYBER BULLYING NEEDS TACKLING Described as the use of the Internet cell phones or other devices to transmit text or images to hurt or embarrass another person cyberbullying is on the rise among kids in India according to a poll conducted by global research firm Ipsos Three out of ten Indian parents report that their children have been victims and the problem is bigger in India than in the West Social networking sites like Facebook most popular devices Like in the US the number of suicides due to cyberbullying is also on the rise and the Union home ministry has asked state governments and police forces tobe vigilant about cyber offenders Apart from verbal ridicule snatching money and lunch boxes from others or getting them to do their schoolwork are the other forms that bullying can take This trait of dominating and threatening others through mockery or hitting starts at a young age but is dismissed by people who justify this behaviour by calling it smart and bold Unlike the West the attitude in India is quite different Indian parents hate admitting that their child could be a bully points out Dr Merchant But this can become a serious problem Parents and teachers often shrug off such behaviour as a teenage problem that will subside naturally Counsellors are approached only when the situation spirals out of hand says Khosla Bullying is a reflection of deep rooted problems bullying others is a way of covering up her own insecurities and jealousy says Khosla Getting to the cause of the problem is essential A missing sense of empathy from parents makes some girls laugh at others shortcomings Kids need to learn to accept others better instead of putting them down says Dr Merchant Parents need to develop an open relationship with their daughters be aware of what s happening at school and what her friendships mean to her Communicate freely with your child If she says she is being bullied listen to her Do nt dismiss complaints about your daughter from school or other kids parents casually either says Dr Merchant Facebook is nt free The real cost of online sharing Scope of company s data collection makes it an advertiser s dream Facebook on Wednesday filed to raise 5 billion in an initial public offering Photograph by Leon Neal AFPGetty Images You may not put a price on your privacy but Facebook does The giant social networking company counts on its 845 million users willingness to share personal information to make money It gives you all sorts of services from posting those cute baby photos to finding out what your friends are reading In return Facebook gets a treasure trove of data to mine from your favourite music to your tastes in sushi to the last book you read and parlays it into lucrative ad sales As the company filed papers Wednesday for its initial public offering to raise at least 5 billion making it one of the largest IPOs in the United States and the largest Internet IPO it s clear investors also And it underscores just how much people are willing to give up in return for getting free online services These free services they give they are not free said Simon Fraser University communications professor Peter ChowWhite They may not cost money but we are entering into an agreement we are getting something for free But what we are going to give up is our privacy at least with that company Lest you think your updates and activities are nt of interest to anyone but your Facebook friends consider this quote from Kathleen Smith principal of IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital in a Computerworld story The social networking king is an advertiser s dream accessing the intimate social interactions of one in every 10 people in the world Last year Facebook earned 1 billion on sales of 37 billion with advertising at close to 32 billion accounting for 85 per cent of its revenue Facebook is nt alone in making money Google a company currently facing its own controversy In Google s case the furore arose over the unification of the privacy policies of its many services from Gmail to YouTube and others under a single policy The net effect is as long as you are signed into a Google service the company can collect all your activities on its other services compiling a wealth of data on you that could be used for targeted advertising But users may be pushing back Google has come under criticism for its privacy update and more than half of users surveyed by the security firm Sophos say they are worried about Facebook s move to make its new feature Timeline mandatory for all users Timeline is a digital scrapbook that collects every item on your Facebook profile starting with your baby photos or videos and moving right along to the latest song you listened to or the update in which you complained about your boss You can put a limit on just who can go back in your timeline A quick perusal of Facebook shows many users either do nt know or do nt care about their privacy settings ChowWhite says the risks in online sharing have nt reached a point where people are worried about it Sure there are the stories about people losing jobs over intemperate posts losing insurance cases or in the case of Stanley Cup rioters being identified through their online boasting But it s not enough to scare people Also as they becomes more and more important in how we organize our business lives our home lives and our friendships our communications networks become really important for doing that ChowWhite said ChowWhite suggests there is not enough critical mass around the issue to lead us to really understand the risks of online sharing Until that risk is really understood the benefits of being in the network far outweigh the risks of being in the network for now and that does nt seem to be slowing down he said when sharing everything is the norm the risks and the consequences may become apparent too late Some of them do nt know the consequences of sharing everything especially as their digital footprint or digital identity will be walking into the room with them on job applications ChowWhite said What will be on the table wo nt just be their CV it will be their Facebook account their Twitter account all sorts of things We encourage all readers to share their views

the final hearing before his trial begins in April The rightwing extremist who has admitted killing 77 people in Norway told a court yesterday that he deserved a medal of honour for the bloodshed and demanded to be set free Anders Behring Breivik smirked and gave a salute as he was led in to the Oslo district court handcuffed and dressed in a dark suit for his last detention hearing before his trial starts on April 16 He stretched out his arms in what his lawyer Geir Lippestad said was some kind of Rightwing extremist greeting Breivik a 32yearold Norwegian told the court that Norway s most deadly peacetime attack was a strike against traitors he said are embracing immigration to promote an Islamic colonisation of Norway He said I am a militant nationalist I represent the Norwegian indigenous peoples We in the Norwegian resistance movement are turned into a minority in our own country About 100 survivors and relatives of victims watched in disbelief as Breivik asked to be released and told the judge he should be awarded Norway s highest military medal for the July 22 massacre Cuffed The 32yearold raises his arms to a guard as he arrived at the court which was filled with around 100 survivors and family members of the massacre he carried out in July last year No remorse Breivik smiles at the camera left and at people inside the court room after his arrival this morning He has admitted killing 77 people during two attacks in Oslo and on Utoya island last year The incident occurred after the Conservative peer took exception at remarks by exCabinet minister Lord King suggesting veterans of the World War Two were looking pretty old Age worn lightly The peer who worked at codebreaking facility Bletchley Park during the war told the BBC afterwards that she had intended the gesture but she and the former defence secretary remained jolly good friends Mr Clarke follows in the footsteps of the likes of Sir David Attenborough and Joanna Lumley in winning the award Broadcaster Jon Snow one of the judges said Mr Clarke had been an MP for more than 40 years and a minister for 30 while maintaining a varied range of interests outside politics including jazz and cigars This year he will be 72 still one of the most characterful men on either front bench He displays all the characteristics of a castiron Oldie true to his principles age worn lightly still in the job long after his work Margaret Thatcher and John Major Not only is he justifiably and prominently the Oldie of the Year but he is also the political survivor of the year Baroness Trumpington also served in government under Margaret Thatcher The Oldie said her award was in recognition of her being a stalwart of the old school and robust champion of the senior citizen Referring to the exchange with Lord King it said she had registered her objection in swift and incontrovertible terms Within the space of just a few days more than 75000 consumers signed up to a pioneering campaign to secure cheaper gas and electricity tariffs Which has launched the first collective purchasing trial for energy in Britain although such schemes have been used successfully in other European countries such as the Netherlands Already the Big Switch scheme has crossparty support the new Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said he wants to see other similar schemes launched in a bid to drive down energy costs for consumers while the shadow minister Caroline Flint below right described it as a trailblazing way to help bring down soaring bills But how does the scheme work and what can you save The following questions and answers provide more information This is another name for group buying Which is coordinating the initiative and is looking for as many people to signup as possible The more names it gets the able to persuade the energy companies to offer a more competitive deal What rates are being offered This is nt known as yet Once the registration period ends and Which knows how many consumers have signed up it will invite the major energy suppliers to bid for their business It will conduct a reverse auction offering the deal to the company with the lowest tariff It will then contact individual home owners detailing the potential savings and inviting them to switch How many people are likely to sign up People have until the end of March to join the campaign Given that 40000 have signed up so far the numbers are likely to run into the hundreds of thousands Richard Lloyd executive director of Which added The bigger the group the stronger our bargaining power will be We are urging anyone who is angry about the state of the energy market to sign up The Big Switch is the first chance will the energy suppliers offer cheaper tariffs I thought they had just lowered their prices The company that secures this deal can expect to win thousands of new customers so it is hoped suppliers will tender some competitive rates And as this is the first of these schemes there will no doubt be considerable publicity for whichever supplier wins the auction If I sign up will I be obliged to switch No Once the deal has been secured Which will contact all those who have signed up giving them a personalised estimate of the likely savings You are nt obliged to switch so if the savings are nt significant enough or you do nt like the terms of the deal you simply stick with your current provider According to Ofgem the energy regulator about 60pc of consumers have never switched energy providers But it s hoped initiatives like this may encourage more to switch if it produces bigger savings and is spearheaded by a trusted consumer brand such live No This is a nationwide scheme Usually suppliers will quote different rates for different regions But here Which is asking for a rate that will be applicable for all regions This may mean that some people stand to make more substantial savings than others After the auction consumers will be asked to provide details such as postcode and current energy consumption so Which can provide a more accurate estimate of potential savings Who will save the most Those who have never switched before pay their bills quarterly by cheque and still get their gas and electricity from different suppliers stand to make the biggest savings But it s hoped that the rate offered will beat the current best buys potentially benefiting a far wider group of consumers What if I am on a fixedrate tariff There is usually a penalty to pay from moving away from a fixedrate tariff during the period most are one or twoyear contracts This does nt stop you signing to factor in this penalty when calculating potential savings It may means it s not cost effective to switch Will I have to move to online billing and paying by direct debit It s not yet known what type of deal will be secured It may be an online tariff or may require customers to pay by direct debit Mr Lloyd said they were aiming for a relatively simple deal that would appeal to as many people as possible There are likely to be options though for those who only want to switch one fuel How long will the deal last This will depend what deals are offered via the auction It could be that this is a oneyear deal which will require customers to stick with the supplier for 12 months It s unlikely to tie them in for any longer period If this proves successful then Which may run a similar scheme next year which would be open both to new customers and to those who have taken advantage of this While 5m people switch energy suppliers a year the majority of people have never moved Which has previously estimated that energy companies are making some 4bn a year from this consumer apathy which is the difference between the standard tariffs which are paid by the majority of consumers and the most competitive deals offered new customers One of the reasons cited for people not switching is there is little perceived difference between the major suppliers It is hoped that this approach whereby a third party negotiates on behalf of a large group of consumers may prove a more effective way of driving down energy costs Who else could offer such a scheme Mr Lloyd said if the Big Switch proved successful it was an idea they were keen to apply to other markets There has been talk of local authorities trade and credit unions and housing associations offering their own collective purchasing deals Although on a smaller scale similar arrangements are deployed to buy heating oil Comparison pass on the bulk discount to consumers And village schemes are becoming increasingly popular such as the one set up in West Challow Oxfordshire Up to 95pc of the village has signed up cutting fuel costs by up to 1p per litre The website Incahootcom which already offers group discount deals on utility bills is now also offering a shopping discount scheme Court chaos follows interpreter change Image caption The agency admitted there had been some teething troubles The government is hoping to save 18m a year by changing how interpreters are provided for court hearings but it is said the new system is causing chaos and costly delays A suspect charged with perverting the course of justice is told they are accused of being a pervert Another is told that being charged means they have to give the police money Two incidents cited by those opposed to the new system Courts in England and Wales previously hired freelance interpreters from a national register Now they are provided by a single agency Applied Language Solutions ALS which has promised to cut the annual 60m translation bill by a third While the company says despite some teething troubles it is operating well 60 of the 2300 of those on the National Register of Public Service Interpreters are refusing to work for it after their pay was slashed 85 a quarterhourly rate after three hours and were paid for travel time and expenses but this has been replaced by hourly fees in three tiers of 16 20 and 22 plus no travel time and reduced expenses In some cases an interpreter s pay would be halved for the same three hours of work while those who used to travel long distances to assignments could be out of pocket For example one Lithuanian interpreter who regularly travelled to Devon from Surrey and used to get 246 for a day s shift would now be 65 down after travel costs Specialised job Some fear the change could have more damaging consequences The interpreters membership body the Professional Interpreters Alliance says the boycott is forcing ALS to employ people with little experience of the legal system We are already hearing horror stories from all over the country Being a court interpreter is a specialised and difficult job You have to be accurate as people said There is a huge demand for interpreters to help defendants witnesses and victims understand the legal system Case study solicitor I represented a Polish Roma woman who was attending for the second time She speaks no English at all On the first occasion no one had thought to arrange an interpreter although one had been provided police station and her case had to be adjourned Shortly after I arrived at court the usher showed me a fax from the court office indicating that the interpreter organisation could not provide a Polish interpreter at all As the chairman of the bench remarked we could probably find several on the High Street Fortunately the defendant had brought a cousin who spoke English John Storer a solicitor for a firm in Boston Lincolnshire says 20 of the local population are migrant workers meaning 2025 of his clients do not speak English We rely on interpreters for cases from murder to motoring offences beginning of February solicitors translators and magistrates across England and Wales have reported numerous cases of interpreters failing to attend not speaking the right language and not accurately translating proceedings In one case a Lithuanian man was in custody for theft on a Monday but as no interpreter was present he was remanded without a bail application as his solicitor simply could not get any information from him He was eventually dealt with on a third occasion a week later One of the PIA interpreters listened to part of the interpreting during the crossexamination of the defendant and the closing speeches in a case at a crown court which they described as very vague and incomplete They reported I would say one fifth of what was being said in court was interpreted to the defendant At one stage the interpreter instead of interpreting what the judge was saying was telling the defendant that she thought the judge was nice and sympathetic towards the defendant s case of the West London bench of magistrates said the cost of sending defendants back to custody when interpreters failed to show could mean the change was a false economy I had a case where the interpreter did nt turn up and I was stuck between a rock and a hard place It s not right to proceed when the chap does nt really understand what s going on but it s also not very just or fair on him to put it off for another day and leave him sitting in a cell overnight while we get an interpreter he said On top of that there are all the other agencies because it s not just the defendant it s the police the probation the defence the CPS they are all incurring costs because there s no interpreter there Rebecca Niblock a solicitor specialising in extradition cases said it could pose problems for the justice system further down the line There is inevitably bound to be said not just in court but in speaking to their lawyers It s not just their presence that is required but their input whether they are pleading guilty or not guilty if there s any uncertainty over what s said that leaves the door open to appeals We are closely monitoring the service will investigate any complaints made ALS spokeswoman Mr Storer said his firm would employ freelance interpreters using Legal Aid money if it was not satisfied with the standard of ALS interpreters Good interpreters save money as can speed things up they are fully aware of the legal process they know exactly what to do and what s expected of them and they just get things done he said Mike Jones Chairman of the Criminal Law Solicitors Association said he was concerned by what his members were telling him Accurate interpretation is absolutely essential to the operation of the criminal justice system in the police station magistrates court and crown court was closely monitoring the operation of the new contract and working with the contractor to ensure it worked as effectively as possible An ALS spokeswoman said 3000 interpreters are registered with the company who are then vetted for their qualifications and undergo independent assessment The service was rolled out nationally less than two weeks ago and has been operating well although there have inevitably been some teething troubles she said We are closely monitoring the service will investigate any complaints made about the system and make changes and improvements as necessary Assigning qualified and experienced linguists to assignments and insisting on continuous professional development while reducing operational inefficiencies remains the focus of our service Business leader found guilty of nine sex crimes A leading

traditionally hunted as a pest but a booming market in civet coffee has changed its fate turning it from pest into producer Civets alamid are catlike nocturnal creatures with a proclivity for sweet coffee berries The discerning civet will choose only the ripest berries from the coffee tree and process the pulp but not the bean It takes around 20 minutes for the carnivorous creature to digest the berry and discard the bean intact ADVERTISEMENT Gastric juices of the civet penetrate the coffee bean leaving tiny holes only visible under a microscope The digestion process produces an inimitable coffee tasting experience Rare unique product Coffee aficionados ca nt get enough of this rare and unique product Selling for as much as 50 per cup in luxury markets civet coffee is the most expensive coffee in the world largest markets for the luxury beverage but demand continues to grow across the world Gerald Jr works the land of his father and grandfather spanning some 40 hectares of dense native forest His mission is to preserve traditional Ifugao farming practices and introduce new ones that will protect civets and their forests Harvesting methods remain unchanged in Asipulo coffee is still picked and processed by loving hands The biggest difference is that the new generation of farmers look to the coffee beans on the forest floor and not the berries in the tree Beginning in June 2007 Gerald Jr was the first in Asipulo to harvest civet coffee alongside his ordinary crop While other farmers continued to throw away civet coffee and hunt the crop destroying creature Gerald Jr promotes their survival and usefulness Gerald Jr also rejects slashandburn techniques which some coffee farmers still practice We do nt like to follow their system of just open farming cutting down the trees we just plant coffee under them Economic sense eventually won over local farmers Instead of collecting ordinary coffee and selling it wholesale to large companies Asipulo farmers have tapped into the luxury civet coffee market abroad Gerald Jr coordinates the sale of Asipulo civet coffee exporting it directly to the US Switzerland and Canada Civet coffee is also sold locally well below international market prices Arabica civet beans fetch 70 per 100g while Robusta civet beans sell for 40 per 100g Origin The origins of civet coffee have gained mythical status and date back to Dutch colonial Indonesia in the 18th century So the story goes the Dutch forbid local plantation workers from picking coffee berries for their own use The Indonesian workers noticed that local civets consumed the berries and discarded the bean Keen to try the exotic brew locals collected civet coffee beans for themselves Long popular in Indonesia civet coffee only emerged in international Many hands make light work during the laborintensive harvest season In the community if you need help they come and help And you help them in return Gerald Jr explains Once the civet coffee is collected it is thoroughly washed and dried It is then pounded in a mortar and pestle to separate the bean from the shell Beans are exported unroasted while beans sold locally are roasted in a traditional charcoal and clay pot In November last year a quality test tasting of civet coffee was conducted in Switzerland The civet coffee market has been flooded with cheap civet coffee of dubious quality and authenticity Enterprising farmers across Southeast Asia have established cagedcivet farms Caged civets are fed large amounts of coffee only a small part of their diet in the wild and farmers are able to produce much larger quantities for lower prices The Swiss event entitled Taste the Myth featured Philippine civet coffee from Asipulo which was and Swiss Coffee scientist Dr Chahan Yeretzian among others Mild full flavor Dr Yeretzian used a microscope to verify the civet coffee s authenticity Strittmatter admired the mild full flavor While ordinary coffee has a bitter aftertaste civet coffee is strong but smooth its flavors linger on the tongue GoGi is the star of Gerald Jr s civet rehabilitation center When she was found in a hunter s trap in February last year she was halfstarved and scared Now the normally nocturnal animal spends her days wandering around her enclosure attracting curious passersby Gerald Jr hopes to bring an end to all civet hunting in the community If we know somebody who keeps a civet alive we go and get them But we do nt do it by force of course we do nt want to break the social interaction with the community Gerald Jr often pays the hunter for injured civets and explains that preserving experience there are many civets who die because they are very sensitive once they are injured it becomes worse if it is not treated and they soon will die Gerald Jr is optimistic about what the future holds He wants to increase civet coffee production across Asipulo and promote local development The local community is increasingly concerned with environmental preservation They believe the survival of the civet and fate of the community are intertwined It s about keeping the forest and how to make profit from the resources of the forest says Gerald Jr A 28yearold man was arrested on Thursday afternoon for allegedly using some P11500 in counterfeit bills at an electronic gambling station in Manila Sencon Sabidin of Taguig City was caught carrying 23 pieces of fake P500 bills one of which he had used undetected to play an ebingo machine He claimed he got the bills from a friend in Quiapo Manila Supt Ferdinand Quirante of the Manila Police District MPD Meisic station 11 said Sabidin was first accosted at around 430 pm by security officers of the New Divisoria Mall Bingo Center on the third floor of the Divisoria Mall along Sto Cristo Street in Binondo ADVERTISEMENT He was later turned over to the police Quirante said that before the arrest Sabidin was playing one of the ebingo machines when the manager Christopher Diaz asked him to move to another since it was time to take the cash out of that particular unit Diaz immediately noticed a fake P500 bill on top of the wads of cash became suspicious of Sabidin since he was the last person who used it Quirante said When questioned at the administrative office Sabidin yielded 22 more pieces of fake peso bills bearing four similar serial numbers prompting Diaz to report him to the MPD station the officer said Angel Locsin and John Lloyd Cruz s new more adult romcom Unofficially Yours breaks some of the rules of its film type like slowly but surely settling up its love story so that viewers can empathize with every step of the lead couple s romance up to its final blissful climax and apotheosis which is usually a big wedding That may work for most romcoms but Cathy GarciaMolina s new film turns the tried and tested format on its head by starting with Angel and John Lloyd in the full throes of a onenight stand The shocking or at least surprising scene explains the flick s more adult tag and marks at least an uptick in the screen couple s continuing process of maturation It works better for Angel than it does for Lloydie because his relatively soft and healthy physique is not exactly the stuff of which bolder bed scenes are made or made for being game enough to add bite to their previously safe screen exposure literally Some other popular stars would have balked at the edgier challenge so hats off to the two for their guts or gumption After that hot opening sequence the characters go back to being strangers until by some corkscrewy twist of fate they find themselves working in the same newspaper office John Lloyd is clearly smitten but Angel does nt reciprocate because we find out in due time she s been burned by the fickle flames of love so onenight or onemonth stands are fine with her absolutely no commitments please John Lloyd grudgingly agrees to the rather cold and utilitarian arrangement but viewers may be less amenable to it because just a few months ago they watched another movie about a hardhearted girl My Cactus Heart so perhaps they ca nt be blamed for wondering why they re being After dealing with that momentary downer however the viewer can still find interesting things in the film to keep watching For one thing the two leads portrayals are nothing if not earnest and committed Still John Lloyd looks a bit too mature for his role So when he occasionally indulges in pacute and pangkilig antics they come off as rather forced and inappropriate Angel comes off better but she too is limited by her tense way of delivering her lines at times even through clenched teeth If this is motivated by her perception of the unhappiness of the character she plays it s a distracting rather than clarifying gambit Penultimately the movie reveals the details of Angel s previous love trauma but the sharing comes too late to be truly useful Another limitation is that her former lover is played by Patrick Garcia whose vague performance adds little to our understanding of the issues Finally Angel s lastminute change of heart is because no newspaper would allow itself to be used for such personal selfserving purposes All told Unofficially Yours has more going against rather than for it but the leads committed portrayals keep us hoping for the best up to the final fade A brother of action star Robin Padilla is facing charges for allegedly threatening to shoot a man and lob a grenade at his house in February 2003 in Quezon City Nearly a decade after the incident Assistant City Prosecutor Rafael Villordon found probable cause to file a case of grave threats against Roy Royette Cari o Padilla a onetime actor with an address on Maple Street West Fairview Padilla is a member of the famous clan whose members include show biz personalities like brother Robin and the transsexual BB Gandanghari formerly Rustom Padilla ADVERTISEMENT No stranger to controversy Royette made headlines in the 1990s when he claimed being a brigadier general in a group called HWorld United Nations Philippine Military Government International Police Commission A twopage indictment concerning the 2003 complaint was received on Feb 15 by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court It stemmed from allegations that Padilla had threatened to harm Johnny Solevilla on Feb s home in Barangay San Antonio at around 1 am to see his daughter Ivonne Villordon said Padilla s alleged statement that he would lob a grenade and shoot Solevilla amounted to grave threats Said threats amounted to a crime of arson and murder and the threats were not subject to a condition the prosecutor said in a resolution dated Dec 1 2011 Bail is not necessary unless required by the court Padilla was actually the first to file a complaint against Solevilla for illegal discharge of firearms and oral defamation He claimed hearing Solevilla cursing him and firing a gun as he was pressing the doorbell of the house prompting him to report the matter to the police and the media Villordon dismissed the complaint against Solevilla for insufficiency of evidence Related Stories Related Videos Alarms have been raised

loved the kind of technology and the amount of information we have in these days It s certainly a concern says David Murakami Wood Canada Research Chair in Surveillance Studies at Queens University Murakami Wood said while we are nt in a governmentled Big Brother surveillance society yet the potential is there and there is a lack of awareness about how often we are observed and tracked There is an apathy about it They are generally aware they have seen Minority Report but they are not aware enough at all he said From secret surveillance at border crossings to GPS tracking of shopping habits the watchful eye is on us like no other time in can be used to remove power from governments as the revolts in the Arab Spring have shown democracies must stay vigilant that it does nt go the other way as well In Germany they are the ones who always remind us what they had to endure in the Third Reich and how easily things can change Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian warns Do nt think that this is impossible or far from reality and that is why we have to be vigilant to protect the freedoms we have now They start with privacy it is at the heart of all of our freedoms At the border For the first time in our shared history exit controls will start being used on all Canadians and Americans when they leave their country of citizenship The practice was agreed to in 2011 when the latest security agreement was signed between Ottawa and Washington Starting in 2014 when a US border guard leans in your car window and asks he will instantly share that information with the Canadian government To avoid the fuss the new Nexus program just scans the iris of your eyeball at the CanadaUS border again just like in the film Minority Report and knows what you are up to without having to see your passport or ask questions The handheld computers can pinpoint a person s location to within 12 inches of where they are standing any place on the planet where satellite signals can find them New technology using smartphones allowed stores to follow people through malls for first time this past Christmas monitoring and mapping shoppers movements Companies hope to use the collected data for direct advertising Police use phone GPS data to track suspects and then use it in court to put the accused at the scene of a crime or to give them an alibi This notion of having cellphones that are constantly recording where everyone goes has been very good for the government says Jeff Fischbach recorded and presents it for court cases This default that when you delete something it simply disappears from sight but is still available to be found does nt serve the individual Maybe it s just a coincidence that the US government is the biggest customer of these companies In the car Turn off the GPS functions on your phone That s OK Modern vehicles all have GPS transponders to track the car s locater beacon even if the assistance program is nt subscribed to If you are running a newer car it s probably communicating with the dealership and you will get a cellphone call reminding you your car needs a tuneup New cars have significant twoway data streams says Fischbach New tires they may have imbedded in the rubber some RFID chips Those chips will send out data They were nt sold as a way to follow your vehicle but they could certainly be used that way In the United numbers of passing cars constantly running the digits through a database with the owners photograph popping up on screen Out of the car security cameras in parking lots and computers built into pay meters record your movements and note the time Where you live If you think you re safe from prying eyes at home think again We can get data from surveillance cameras kitchen appliances video game systems televisions cars smart phones anything at all with a computer I can get information out of it says Fischbach Alarm systems now include cameras with webstreaming and twoway microphones provided by the same companies that offer phone television and Internet connections Along with the fisheye webcams built into most computer monitors new smart televisions have them embedded into the sets allowing for interactive TV shows and video telephone calls much like the wall screens described by Ray Bradbury in his dystopic novel Farenheit 451 Some the owner knowing about

snapping pictures of sleeping teens Over the last four years UK local councils have spend 550 million pounds on CCTV cameras Just local council cameras we have 51000 of them not counting central government police and transport says Emma Carr spokeswoman for Big Brother Watch in the UK It s very much a generational divide The younger generation have become desensitized to these cameras because we have grown up with them watching us all of the time in London on average you are caught 300 times a day on a camera In the US cities are installing video cameras in public spaces that can read text from hundreds of feet away Other cameras being installed in New Jersey zoom in and record when two people come close them London has talking cameras We are about to deploy lightprojecting cameras East Orange police Chief William Robinson says The cameras can shoot a beam a full city block away The message to the criminals is the police are observing you the police are recording you and the police are responding Some people find that disturbing That is the definition of Orwellian says Cavoukian Living in a free and democratic society means that you can walk about freely not being concerned that every act you engage in is being monitored And if you are a lawabiding citizen it is your right not to be monitored on a 247 basis In the air and everywhere In George Orwell s 1984 the protagonist Winston Smith gets away from totalitarian prying eyes for an afternoon resting in the forest with his secret love When a bird lands nearby and starts singing he wonders What made pour its music into

charge in the death of Eric Osawe inset during Unit an armslength agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been death serious injury or allegations of sexual assault laid the charge in consultation with the Crown It s the first time a Toronto police officer has been charged with murder for an onthejob incident and it sends a very disturbing message to police said Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack To suggest that an officer performing his duties executing a search warrant with a team would have intent to murder somebody is absolutely appalling he said We ve lost confidence in the Crown attorneys office and the SIU for our members to be treated fairly and impartially The Emergency Task Force and guns and gangs unit were searching an apartment in the city s west end on Sept 29 2010 when the SIU alleges Cavanagh shot Osawe He was shot in the back said Julian Falconer the family s lawyer Osawe s closeknit family has been distraught over his death

upgraded saying as far as the defence knows there is no new evidence There has been no adequate explanation given to the defence said Peter Brauti McCormack is concerned the charge will have a chilling effect on police officers He said he has already heard comments to that effect from some of them We have to know that when we re making splitsecond decisions and taking action that our

go before the April seal hunt starts off the Newfoundland and Labrador coast the international market for pelts has all but disappeared says the Canadian Sealers Association In previous years 95 per cent of our products went into Russia and on Jan 1 the Russian Federation announced a ban on all seal products and there is not alternative place to sell it right now Frank Pinhorn executive director of the association told the Toronto Star Friday Even last year when Russia was still in the game only a few thousand seals were killed because the price for pelts was only 20 compared to a high of 115 in 2006 The laws of economics wo nt allow you do it Pinhorn said given the cost of fuel and ammunition Pinhorn said the slow death of the sealing industry will set off a domino effect more seals and less fish Together he said this spells the end to herd of harp seals is getting larger every year he said noting that the ice conditions this year are near perfect for the females to give birth to an expected 16 million pups The estimated seal harp seal population has doubled since 2005 from 56 million to more than 9 million Pinhorn said adding that each one of them eat 14 tonnes of fish each year The question is this the end of harvesting seals Well if it is it is also the end of rural Newfoundland and Labrador as we know it What happens if the herd goes to 12 million or even 15 million Pinhorn said not only are the seals gobbling up the fish stock there has also been a 35 per cent decrease in the crab quota because seal consume a tremendous amount of female crabs Pinhorn said not only will there not be seal pelts there wo nt be seal oil for Omega 3 capsules which are a popular supplement do not know if any seals are being bought this year he said Newfoundland Fisheries Minister Darin King said in January the government was considering buying pelts for a stockpile that would be sold off if and when markets improve A marketing group in Wisconsin wants to give walking tours of the bar where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer met and hung out with some of his victims Sara Drescher manager at 5th Ward Pub in the Walker s Point neighborhood in Milwaukee where a marketing company is organizing a walking tour of bars where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer hunted his victims Drescher has mixed feelings on the subject ByCarrie AntlfingerAssociated Press Published on Fri Mar 02 2012 MILWAUKEE A marketing group in Wisconsin wants to give walking tours of the bar where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer met and hung out with some of his victims But when victims families and others found out about the tours this week through a Groupon promotion for a cutrate tour they started calling for the tour which they described as insensitive and in poor taste to end Bam Marketing and Media spokeswoman Amanda Morden said Thursday the company is not deterred and the first two tours are Saturday in Milwaukee and have nearly group president Victor Ray who says it s too soon for a tour since the crimes are just 2 decades old and many family members of Dahmer s victims are still around I just do nt think this is the right timing said Ray who heads the Walker s Point Association And a tour of the area is not the right thing to do It s sensationalism in its finest Ray said he s received 75 emails most against the tours and that some plan to protest Saturday including some family members of victims He said he s been in contact with one victim s mother who asked for his group s help She said Do what you can to stop it Ray said The woman did nt want to be interviewed by reporters He met with Morden and another tour group representative Thursday night and hoped he had convinced them to quit the tours But Morden said they have a legitimate the crimes rather than the sensational nature of them Dahmer a chocolate factory worker would frequent gay bars in the area He was arrested in 1991 and admitted to killing 17 young men some of whom he mutilated and cannibalized He was serving life prison sentences when a fellow inmate beat him to death in 1994 His apartment building where he stored body parts was eventually razed There s been talk over the years about putting a memorial there but the idea has received mixed reactions Morden said they hoped to put a plaque with the victims names on one of the businesses in the area as a memorial She also said a portion of the tour profits will be donated to charity although a specific one has nt been chosen Ray called it a token gesture I do nt think that s going to make a difference to the community he said The area is in the middle of a revitalized section of that once housed bars Dahmer would frequent Morden described it as a legitimate walking tour that looked at the killer s crimes from a historical perspective rather than with macabre fascination She compared it to a book or a documentary but in a different format Whether we like it or not it s part of our city s history she said It s part of our nation s history Morden said she thought enough time had passed to look at the crimes objectively The tour group is sensitive to the victims families she said but has not sought their feedback We are not being evasive in any way she said If there is a concern we would be happy to address it At least two schools have expressed interest for educational reasons she said Plans have been made to meet with them next week Groupon offered two tickets for 25 instead of the normal 60 and into Dahmer s life But only 15 tickets sold before the dailydeal website closed the promotion Spokesman Nicholas Halliwell said in an emailed statement that it was never Groupon s intention to offend anyone It s not unusual for gruesome crimes to become part of a city s lore There are tours in London about Jack the Ripper in Los Angeles about Charles Manson and in Boston about the Boston Strangler But local tourism group VISIT Milwaukee wo nt promote it We do nt need to give notoriety to an individual like Jeffrey Dahmer who did painful and hurtful things and did nothing to further the community s image spokeswoman Jeannine Sherman said Alderman James Witkowiak said the city ca nt stop the tours because organizers are using public spaces and they are protected by free speech laws It s more of a grey area for Sara Drescher who manages a pub in the neighbourhood She did nt think it would affect business and she doubted there would be much people being able to start a business but not at the expense of victims families It s a difficult thing and I do nt know the right way for it to be handled Drescher said Iceland s newfound love for the loonie is sparking a wave of controversy from Reykjavik to Ottawa For 150 years the rest of the world has shown scant interest in the Canadian dollar the poor cousin to the coveted US greenback But now tiny Iceland still reeling from the aftershocks of the devastating collapse of its banks in 2008 is looking longingly to the loonie as the salvation from wild economic gyrations and suffocating capital controls Social media Former Industry Minister Jim Prentice now CIBC s vicechair is photographed at The Globe and Mail March 1 2012 He had been speaking about the economic benefits of nation building infrastructure investment across Canada the challenges to Canadian manufacturing of a high Canadian dollar and how the nation can navigate a way forward Peter Power The Globe and Mail Market View Canadian ambassador to Iceland Alan Bones had planned to deliver remarks to a conference on the future of the Icelandic Krona making it with all its inherent risks Canada was ready to talk But his speech slated for Saturday was abruptly cancelled when news of the remarks was reported in Iceland and Canada led by The Globe and Mail Once we got wind of the speechand it went through the approval channels we decided it was not an appropriate venue said Joseph Lavoie Foreign Minister John Baird s press secretary It s a political event So that the decision was made that it s not an appropriate event for him to speak at While he may have thought about delivering those remarks those remarks wo nt be delivered Mr Lavoie pointed to a statement issued late Friday by the department as the government s official position Canada does not comment publicly on other countries currencies according to the statement This is an issue for the Icelandic government and people A group of prominent Icelandic business leaders approached Mr Bones to a meeting the country s opposition Progressive Party would have been Canada s first public response The Bank of Canada referred all calls about the issue to the Finance Department where officials were tightlipped There s a compelling economic case why Iceland would want to adopt the Canadian dollar It offers the tantalizing prospect of a stable liquid currency that roughly tracks global commodity prices nicely matching Iceland s own economy which is dependent on fish and aluminum exports and in the future energy There s also a more sentimental reason They re both cold Arctic countries The average person looks at it this way Canada is a younger version of the US Canada has more natural resources than the US it s less developed has more land lots of water explained Heidar Gudjonsson an economist and chairman of the Research Centre for Social and Economic Studies Iceland s largest think tank And Canada thinks about the Arctic in the 27member euro zone But support among Icelanders is slipping In a recent Gallup poll seven out of 10 Icelanders said they would happily dump their volatile and fragile krona for another currency Their favoured alternative is the Canadian dollar easily outscoring the US dollar the euro and the Norwegian krone Iceland is in a bind The country imposed strict currency controls after its spectacular banking collapse in 2008 Foreignexchange transactions are capped at 350000 kronur about 3500 A major downside of those controls is that foreign investors ca nt repatriate their profits making Iceland an unattractive place to do business Those capital controls are slated to start coming off next year And many experts fear a return to the wild swings of the past in inflation lending rates and the currency itself Iceland is the smallest country in the world still clinging to its own currency and monetary policy The krona soared nearly 90 per cent between 2001 and 2007 only to crash 92 per cent Icelandic government plan is to adopt the euro Iceland has applied to join the European Union and eventually the euro zone But that s not looking like a very attractive option these days And formal entry could take a decade experts said The other options are to peg the krona to another currency such as the yen greenback or euro It s hard to imagine Canada would object Iceland would nt have a say in Canadian monetary policy and the dollars coursing through its small economy 12billion in GDP versus Canada s 18trillion would be a blip in the Bank of Canada s management of the money supply Unilaterally taking on another country s currency is not unheard of El Salvador took on the US dollar in 2001 Ecuador did the same in 2000 And Kosovo adopted the euro in 2002 There are some good reasons Canada might want to see Iceland embrace the loonie If you join a new currency area it means you are completely open out Adoption of the Canadian dollar could open opportunities for Canadian shipping companies fish packers banks insurers and eventually oil distributors and service companies as the country taps undeveloped resources Trade between the countries would obviously multiply Mr Gudjonsson argued But the greatest benefit for Canada could be enhanced geopolitical influence in a region that s poised to grow in economic clout The Arctic is the last frontier for the mining and oil and gas industries sectors where Canada is already a global player The Arctic holds an estimated 22 per cent of the world s remaining conventional oil and gas and vast untapped mineral potential The transition would nt be easy The Icelandic government through its central bank would authorize commercial banks to exchange kronur for loonies At today s exchange rate it would take roughly 100 kronur to buy a dollar Iceland would need very strong reserves to conduct the operation which might require an extended period when both currencies would be in COMPARED Iceland Iceland began issuing its own currency the krona in 1885 replacing the Danish currency The flipside of the Iceland notes carry scenes of girls learning to embroider a monastic scribe and 16thcentury printers on the job One krona is worth less than a Canadian cent The 1000 krona note bears the image of Brynjolfur Sveinsson a 17th century Lutheran bishop

Martlets They are ubiquitous to the point that ironically many of us do nt even notice them any more Martlets those footless red birds of mythological fame that have been one of the McGill s most recognizable symbols for more than 160 years Martlets first flew onto campus in 1850 appearing on diplomas and again the following year on the University s annual calendar Over the ensuing decades martlets of all shapes and sizes have appeared on official University items such as flags documents and McGill s coat of arms to more whimsical items like playbills sports uniforms and winter carnival floats Brochure Winter Carnival 1952 In 1922 Principal Sir Arthur Currie asked architecture professor Percy Nobbs to design a coat of arms the patent for which was granted that year by the GarterKingatArms in London England Different versions of the coatofarms were in use until 1975 when McGill s Board of Governors settled upon the Chief Herald of Canada in 1992 In our holdings we have lots of martlets that are more serious in nature that link back to the heraldry and James McGill But we also see martlets being depicted with lots of humour and creativity especially when it comes to student activities says Theresa Rowat Director McGill University Archives Seeing the two side by side is really fun A postcard published by Raphael Tuck amp Sons circa 1907 As part of McGill s ongoing 190th anniversary celebrations Rowat and her team worked in collaboration with Lisa Kisiel from Graphic Design to create two displays commemorating a myriad of martlets through the years One is located on the first floor of the James Building and the other can be found in the passageway connecting Redpath Library to McLennan Library See pages 67 in the print edition of the McGill Reporter

Cupertino s latest tablet waiting in the wings for a March 16 release we re all still speculating when it comes to some of the device s particulars and now the new iPad s allotment of RAM is getting its share of the spotlight According to The Verge the new iPad will indeed feature double the RAM of its immediate predecessor with a full gigabyte of memory ensconced within its aluminum frame But why does nt Apple ever talk about it That Apple would make the jump to 1GB for their newest postPC poster child should nt come as a surprise The original model launched with 256MB of RAM onboard which made for some iffy use experiences after a few software updates The iPad 2 debuted with 512MB under the hood only a matter of time between new features and apps have iPad 2 users feeling the same sort of squeeze Now I ca nt speak for everyone but my childhood in computing was spent scrounging together allowances for new RAM so my offbrand PC would nt chug quite so hard As The Verge rightly points out Apple s iPad line to date has never blown the tech community away with the amount of RAM they ve included Apple s silence on that front is to be expected while they re always eager to talk up their processors and their cameras Apple has historically been content to leave the some of the technical specifics shrouded in mystery And why should nt they By throwing around adjectives like magical incredible and amazing at every possible opportunity consumers are left to focus more on what they can do with an iPad rather than the little bits of silicon that make those experience happen Sex sells and RAM is anything but sexy RAM matters even if Apple would prefer you did nt know about it As apps get more complex and more impressive as they should considering how picky we are about them the demands they exact on a device s hardware grow ever greater More robust system resources means more opportunities for developers to flex their respective muscles and the last thing Apple needs to do is displease the people who generate revenue for them More RAM is a win for nearly everyone involved and while some of us may never see as much as we like in our iDevices that should nt stop Apple from at least talking about it Antibioticresistant Bacteria Sickened 167 Hospitalized 47 in 2011 Related Links Rampant use of antibiotics in animal agriculture means foodborne illnesses are likely to become longer more serious and harder to treat according to the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest In three major outbreaks of antibioticresistant foodborne illness in 2011 167 Americans became sick 47 were hospitalized and one died according to a white paper released by the group today Two of those outbreaks were connected to ground turkey one contaminated with Salmonella Hadar and one with Salmonella Heidelberg and one outbreak was connected to ground beef contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium All of those bacteria were resistant to treatment from several antibiotics that are critically important to human medicine including drugs in the penicillin cephalosporin and tetracycline families Antibiotics are the crown jewels of modern medicine and they are critical to treating diseases in both humans and farm animals said CSPI food safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal We by using them recklessly for nontherapeutic uses on farms and in animal factories Otherwise consumers may face longer illnesses more hospitalizations and more fatalities when exposed to resistant strains of common foodborne pathogens Antibiotic resistance is an inevitable consequence of antibiotic use according to the CSPI report The more antibiotics are used the more bacteria will develop resistance often to more than one drug at a time Pigs chickens and cattle are often administered antibiotics in their feed or water to promote growth or to prevent diseases caused by overcrowding and unsanitary conditions according to CSPI Exacerbating the problem is that farmers in the US can obtain and administer antibiotics without prescriptions or veterinary oversight The drug industry produced more than 29 million pounds of antimicrobial drugs approved for use in food animals according to the Food and Drug Administration CSPI says that food animals consume 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States and that 65 percent of those antibiotics are similar or identical to those used antibioticresistant foodborne illness outbreaks shows that outbreaks were most common in dairy products with 12 such outbreaks since 1973 and ground beef with 10 outbreaks Four outbreaks were linked to poultry with ground turkey appearing for the first time as a source of antibioticresistant bacteria with the two 2011 outbreaks linked to JennieO and Cargill products CSPI presented its findings at a series of briefings for House and Senate staff in Washington along with several leading infectiousdisease physicians and health experts including Drs Jim R Johnson of the University of the Minnesota School of Medicine Stuart Levy of Tufts University School of Medicine and the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics Lance Price of the TGen Center for

weeks after birth Giubilini and Minerva wrote when circumstances occur after birth that would have justified abortion what we call afterbirth abortion should be permissible If a newly born child poses an economic burden on a family or is disabled or is unwanted that child can be murdered in cold blood because the baby lacks intrinsic value and according to Giubilini and Minerva is not a person Giubilini and Minerva wrote actual people s wellbeing could be threatened by a newborn even if healthy child requiring energy money and care which the family might happen to be in short supply of As any parents especially moms will tell you children in general and of love If any of these are lacking or pose what Giubilini and Minerva called a threat does that justify a death sentence Are the lives of newborn babies so cheap Are babies so expendable The murder of newly born children is further justified by Giubilini and Minerva because newborn infants like their slightly younger sisters and brothers in the womb can not have formed any aim that she is prevented from accomplishing In other words no dreams no plans for the future no aims that can be discerned recognized or understood by adults no life This preposterous arbitrary and evil prerequisite for the attainment of legal personhood is not only bizarre it is inhumane in the extreme Stripped of its pseudointellectual underpinnings Giubilini and Minerva rationale for murdering newborns in the nursery is indistinguishable from any other child predator wielding a knife or gun Giubilini and Minerva say the devaluation of newborn babies is inextricably linked to the devaluation of the abortion culture and wrote that they propose to call the practice afterbirth abortion rather than infanticide to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed the newborn baby is comparable with that of a fetus Whether she will exist is exactly what our choice is about These antichild promurder rationalizations remind me of other equally disturbing rants from highly credentialed individuals Princeton s Peter Singer suggested a couple of years ago that There are various things you could say that are sufficient to give some moral status to a child after a few months maybe six months or something like that and you get perhaps to full moral status really only after two years Dr James Watson Nobel laureate for unraveling the mystery of DNA wrote in Prism Magazine If a child were not declared alive until three days after birth then all parents could be allowed the choice only a few are given under the present system The doctor could allow save a lot of misery and suffering I believe this view is the only rational compassionate attitude to have In like manner Dr Francis Crick who received the Nobel Prize with Watson said that no newborn infant should be declared human until it has passed certain tests regarding its genetic endowment and that if it fails these tests it forfeits the right to live The dehumanization of newborns is nt new but it s getting worse Giubilini and Minerva s article must be a wakeup call The lives of young children an unprotected class are under assault Hard questions need to be asked and answered and defenders of life must mobilized We have a duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable from violence As lawmakers we must strive for consistency Why do so many who claim to be proponents of human rights systematically dehumanize and exclude the weakest and most vulnerable human beings from legal protection Why the modernday surge in Why the policy of exclusion rather than inclusion Why is lethal violence against children abortion and premeditated killing of newborn infants marketed and sold as benign progressive enlightened and compassionate Why have so many good people turned a blind eye and looked askance as mothers are wounded by abortion and babies in the womb are pulverized by suction machines twenty to thirty times more powerful than household vacuum cleaners or dismembered with surgical knives or poisoned with chemicals Looking back how could anyone in this House or Senate or both President s Obama and Clinton justify the hideous procedure called partial birth abortion Since 1973 over 54000000 babies have had abortion forced on them Some of those children have been exterminated in the second and third trimester pain capable babies who suffered excruciating pain as the abortionist committed his violence Why are some surprised that the new emerging class of victims newborns are being slaughtered in Holland and elsewhere while a perverse proposal to advanced in an otherwise serious and respected ethics journal Children born and unborn are precious Children sick disabled or healthy possess fundamental human rights that no sane or compassionate society can abridge The premeditated murder of newborn babies is being justified as morally equivalent to abortion Congress the courts the president and society at large have

influence of ancient Sparta From the French Revolution and Nazi Germany through the Cold War USA and onwards to 21st century cinema screens and YouTube ancient Sparta continues to resonate through Western thought more than 2000 years after the peak of its power Now a new book the result of a major University of Nottingham research project led by a worldleading expert on Sparta examines the impact of this classical civilisation in modern times and our prolonged fascination with the politics society and customs of its people Sparta in Modern Thought Politics History and Culture is the first book for more than 40 years to examine the significant modern influence of this ancient Greek citystate The book is the latest publication by the University s research project Sparta in Comparative Perspective Ancient to Modern directed by Professor Stephen Hodkinson from the Department of Classics in the School of Humanities and funded by the Arts and the book with the project s research fellow Dr Ian Macgregor Morris said Images of ancient Sparta have had a major impact on Western thought From the Renaissance to the French Revolution Sparta was invoked by radical thinkers as a model for the creation of an ideal republic Since the 19th century Sparta has typically been viewed as the opposite of advanced liberal and industrial democracies a forerunner of 20th century totalitarian and militaristic regimes such as the Third Reich and the Soviet Union But positive views of the Spartans continue to flourish in contemporary democratic media and culture especially in popular fiction and film In the book 11 leading international experts take readers across 10 centuries from the 12th century Renaissance through to early 21st century popular culture Exploiting hitherto untapped sources from medieval political tracts to declassified CIA documents and YouTube video clips they reveal many previously unknown aspects of Sparta s impact shedding new light on the depth and importance of her role of the book s chapters are written by University of Nottingham staff as part of their research collaboration in the University s Centre for Spartan and Peloponnesian Studies Professor Hodkinson s chapter exposes how American foreign policy and intelligence analysts used Sparta as a model for interpreting the Soviet Union especially in support of President Ronald Reagan s hardline policies towards the USSR in the early 1980s Dr Lynn Fotheringham Lecturer in Classics investigates the positive portrayal of Sparta in 1990s American popular fiction such as Frank Miller s graphic novel 300 and Steven Pressfield s Gates of Fire discussing how they deal with problematic elements of Spartan culture such as infant exposure Dr Kostas Vlassopoulos Associate Professor in Greek History examines how early modern thinkers such as Machiavelli and Montesquieu compared Sparta politically with Rome and how her image changed from aristocratic republic to egalitarian democracy in the increasingly radical intellectual atmosphere of the 18th century Other important topics covered include A major reevaluation by the book s coeditor writers whose portrayals of Sparta s lawgiver Lycurgus provided the foundation for Renaissance conceptions of her sociopolitical order Sparta s significant role in the development of French radical political thought from the Enlightenment through the French Revolution to early Socialist thinking Germany s growing selfidentification with Sparta between 1800 and 1945 culminating in her use by Nazi leaders and ideologues as an Aryan prototype for the racial policies of the Third Reich and the training of future leaders in the Adolf Hitler Schools The impact of new digital technologies and participatory mass culture in the shape of fanmade YouTube video clips parodying the presentation of Sparta in Zack Snyder s 2006 film 300 The book represents the latest publication success of the Sparta in Comparative Perspective project team whose work has received international academic acclaim According to Professor Mogens Herman Hansen of the University of Copenhagen The University of Nottingham has become the world centre of Spartan studies and the achievements of Hodkinson and his team have changed our understanding of Sparta for good academic career studying the social economic political and

the companies are losing 34billion litres of water a year to leaks equivalent to 25 per cent of all water used Thames Water admitted that its last hosepipe ban imposed in 2006 resulted in just a 5 per

376 per year from April just before the hosepipe ban comes in Southern Water which missed its leak targets last year is raising prices by more than 8 per cent Martin Baggs the chief executive of Thames Water warned that prices would have to rise even further to build reservoirs and new technology He said People must use less water during extreme conditions or we have got to have extra resources so people do nt have to have those restrictions His company built the desalination plant in Beckton which will produce 150 million litres every day The plant works by taking water from the river at low tide filtering it and then pumping it through a membrane perforated by millions of minute holes The water produced is so clean that beneficial minerals have to be put back into it But the

speaking to the Press the Leveson Inquiry has been told Scotland Yard was described as a secretive organisation which has clamped down on junior officers talking to the mediaPhoto CHRISTOPHER PLEDGER Sandra Laville crime correspondent for the Guardian newspaper said an overreaction to the crisis had led to a clampdown on all but the most senior officers talking to journalists In a statement to the Inquiry Miss Laville said that as a result Any officer meeting a journalist to make them aware of a pressing issue within the police to highlight racism corruption or incompetence is at risk of a criminal investigation and a disciplinary hearing The Metropolitan Police has come in for repeated criticism over its close relationship with News International and in January a report by Elizabeth Filkin the former parliamentary commissioner for standards suggested that reporters and The report also called for more open and impartial provision of information to the public but Miss Laville said its recommendations were likely to have the opposite effect She said one recommendation in the report that all leaks to journalists should automatically be the subject of a criminal investigation could be seen as criminalising informal contacts between the police and journalists which are vital for holding the police to account It is not enough that the flow of information from a police force is controlled by senior officers and their management board who are driven by the need to protect the corporate image of the police force she added Miss Laville cited the case of Kirk Reid a serial rapist who was finally jailed for life in 2009 following years of incompetence by the Met which had failed to bring him to justice earlier despite dozens of women being attacked by him for almost a decade The Met had chosen not to highlight the case which eventually Commission and it was only because an individual police officer tipped off the media that it came to be reported Miss Laville said that in the current climate the officer who tipped her off about the Reid case would be liable to criminal prosecution even though he was acting in the public interest by ensuring the Met s failures were brought to light Junior officers are already refusing to talk to journalists she said Because there is now a growing culture of fear within Scotland Yard that if they do so they will be subjected to a criminal investigation andor sacked She pointed out that it was senior officers and managers not middle and lowerranking officers who were criticised for their cosy relationships with newspaper executives yet the Met s response has been to give the senior officers and managers even more power She cited the example of Sir Robert Mark who faced a corruption scandal in the 1970s and responded by telling rank and file full support to ensure corruption would be quickly exposed in future and suggested he had struck the right balance New nursing home hospital expansion expected to open by midApril INVERNESS The new Inverary Manor Nursing Home and the expansion to the nearby Inverness Consolidated Hospital should both be open for business by midApril says a spokesman for the Cape Breton District Health Authority This view shows one section of the Inverary Manor Nursing Home which was built in conjunction with an expansion to the nearby Inverness Consolidated Hospital Steve Wadden Cape Breton Post They are doing the final finish work the final bits and pieces like flooring painting and any of the finish work that would be part of any project Greg Boone said when asked when the multimilliondollar joint project of the nursing home and the health authority will be completed In addition the heating and ventilation systems have to be checked to make sure they are working and adjusted correctly The new nursing home will be one of the most modern continuingcare facilities in the region and its staff will be working focus on providing care in the resident s home respecting their individuality and their preferences The hospital has been expanded to include a new community health centre a new ambulatorycare area for expanded clinical services and a renovated emergency department The emergency department wo nt be finished until June said Boone which means some rearrangement of working space for the time being We ve temporarily located the emergency department in what is called the new ambulatorycare area Once the emergency department renovation is finished that department moves back to its original location The new community health centre will have doctor nurse practitioner and family practice nurse offices and examination rooms It will also house communitybased services including addictions and mental health diabetes education publiccommunity health and continuing care The new ambulatorycare area has admitting and oncology and will soon be the base for the renal dialysis service The hospital and manor will share the new production kitchen and an upgraded laundry The hospitalbased physical plant will Because of the shared services with laundry and kitchen we want to make sure the staff is trained the equipment works and the processes are in place said Boone The momentum toward the opening is growing Both projects are on schedule he added with few if any significant problems to slow things down We saw the usual things in relation to weatherrelated delays and that would come with these types of projects when you are working through all seasons And we had to do some backfilling on one area for some of the hospital expansion work he said But nothing significant nothing that could nt be overcome with a bit of additional planning and adjusting An open house for the public is being planned and will include tours of both the new

attempts to knock the ball away from West Side Monarchs Cory Rideout in game two of the bestof five Corner Brook Molson Mens Broomball League final at the Pepsi Centre CORNER BROOK Eric Bourgeois had a Connor Crisp moment on Monday night Investors Group goalkeeper Bob Beck was knocked into by a West Side Monarchs forward during the first shift of Game 2 of the Corner Brook Molson Men s Broomball League s bestofthree final at the Pepsi Centre The lowerbody injury forced him out of the game and the investors were left looking for answers Earlier this month in the Ontario Hockey League a similar situation arose when the Erie Otters lost starting goalie Ramis Sadikov on the same type of play Connor Crisp a forward who had nt played all season was asked to be the emergency goalie He went on to allow star of the game It could be argued Bourgeois was also the first star for his team but it certainly was nt any kind of pity vote as he was successful in backstopping the investors to a 32 overtime win and a 20 lead in the series Michael Hawco was the overtime hero though he was overshadowed somewhat by the mystery man behind the mask down at the other end Lance Ereaut and Rick Kean also scored for the investors Geoff Byrne and Eric Sticky Young responded for the Monarchs For Bourgeois a fiveyear veteran of the sport but firsttime goalkeeper it could nt have gone much better The boys played really well in front of me he said I guess obviously they knew not to let too much through I probably only faced 10 or 12 shots on net because the boys were blocking lots of shots in front of me They were making the extra effort on defence knowing said it became clear the Monarchs smelled blood as soon as he stepped between the posts The Monarchs are smart players and I guess they probably said let s throw everything on net and let s see what happens said Bourgeois They were throwing balls at me from the corner trying to get rebounds One of their goals was a rebound goal like that Though Bourgeois had experience playing in goal during friendly ball hockey games he said there were a few things to get used to right away during a broomball game The big net is a bit scary I looked back and the net is almost over my head he said The ball travels a lot slower too you almost react to it too fast if you have room to see it coming from far out A hockey ball goes twice as fast His emergence may be a blessing in disguise for the investors a massive defensive meltdown in the second half They were forced to focus on playing well in their own end Monday night and that should carry over to Game 3 next week Everyone was taking their man and keeping shots to the outside we just waited for our chances because we ve got enough skill up front and on defence to do that said Bourgeois We want to close it out And he may very well be back in the crease as the last line of defence I do nt know yet he laughed It looks like I could be going for my second win of the year next

be able to take advantage of an extended season for brown trout in the Bras dOr Lake This year anglers will be able to fish brown trout year around in the areas open for rainbow trout The bag limit will be a total of two fish of either species during the period from Oct 1 to March 31 Every year I hear of more anglers fishing for and catching brown trout This is no surprise when you consider how well they have adapted to our waters Brown trout known scientifically as salmo trutta are not native to North America Their natural range is Europe First introduced in Nova Scotia in 1923 in the Milford Haven River of Guysborough County brown trout have become well established in several areas of Cape Breton Since the first fish stocks which were imported referred to them as German browns Later stocks came from Loch Leven in Scotland so some strains were referred to as Loch Leven trout As their name suggests brown trout are brown or golden brown in colour They grow rapidly and can reach some impressive sizes In Europe fish up to 68 pounds have been caught while a sea run brown trout weighing 28 pounds was caught in Witless Bay Newfoundland in 1962 Brown trout are generally found in the same habitats as brook trout but due to their larger size and their ability to tolerate higher water temperatures they often displace brook trout from their range Brown trout tend to seek out deep holes under banks and overhanging trees or anywhere there is some cover These fish lie low during the day and become active at night Fishing them at dusk can be very productive and exciting Anglers living in Cape Breton are fortunate in having a wide selection of brown trout fishing opportunities to choose from Two top areas are produced two current Nova Scotia record brown trout An 184 pound fish caught by Charlie Lahey in 2007 which is the top brown trout in the catch and keep category and a fish which measured 215 inches caught by Pat Young in 2009 is the leader in the live release category In addition to resident trout these areas also have sea run populations of brown trout which makes for fast action during the annual run These sea run fish have spent several seasons feeding in the foodrich coastal areas and can reach some impressive sizes Fishing for brown trout can sometimes make for challenging angling Early in the season spinning gear with worms or minnows can be very successful Later on in the summer when the water drops they can be very selective in what they eat The exception is in the evening when the big browns go on the prowl These big trout pretty well eat everything that swims so a big muddler minnow or mouse imitation can trigger some violent strikes Tight Lines annual Cape Breton Anglers dinner and auction being held this year at the Cape

about his country s ability to organize the greatest Soccer World Cup of all times He has indicated that it may turn out to be the greatest heist in the history of Brazil Romario the soccer player Romario de Souza Faria aka Rom rio or O Baixinho Portuguese for Shorty because of his height is a former Brazilian footballer who played for several top Brazilian soccer teams He has also played for PSV Eindhoven in Netherlands for FC Barcelona and FC Valencia in Spain AlSadd SC of Qatar and for Miami FC in the USA He helped the Brazilian national team achieve victory at the 1994 FIFA World Cup and has been one of the alltime top scorers in the sport only comparable to Brazil s Pel and Ronaldo and to Diego Maradona of Argentina see least twice in 2008 and 2009 and in 2010 he got involved in Brazilian federal politics running for election as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in the Brazilian Socialist Party list He was elected with the sixth largest vote in the state of Rio de Janeiro Romario the politician As a politician Romario has been largely concerned about his country s preparations to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup In several occasions he has criticised the level of preparation of the country for the important international event particularly in connection with the expected date of completion of several stadiums and in the organization and readiness of the ground transportation systems in several cities In recent days Romario has hardened his rhetoric and accused Dilma Rousseff the Brazilian president and Joseph Blatter the president of the International Federation of Association Football FIFA of deceiving Brazilians about how well the preparatory work is progressing Last week Rousseff and Blatter had a meeting to evaluate progress to which congressmen were not invited President Dilma is being deceived or is letting people deceive her Romario said It will be the greatest heist in the history of Brazil Then I ll want to see if the people who were smiling in the photograph in that meeting will want to show up again Brazil is a circus and you already know who the clowns are he added Romario has been an outspoken critic of the preparatory work carried out so far complaining about serious overspending and misuse of public funds He insists that important work that should be going on right now is being purposely delayed until it becomes emergency work thus obviating the need for tenders and a regular bidding process Romario s glass roof The 2014 FIFA World Cup may result a complete success or possibly a great disaster and Deputy Romario may end up being right Unfortunately Deputy Romario s personal reputation and credibility are not all that great He Brazilian soccer player Romario leaves jail Screengrab from ElMundoes ElMundo was elected to office despite a poor personal record and being a highly controversial character In addition to the great praise he has received for his exploits on the soccer field O Baixinho has often been in the press because of wrongdoings During his soccer career he was also known for his love of nightlife absences from training unruly behavior failing a doping test and frequent fights In 2005 Romario was ordered to pay US 22200 to former soccer player Zico Arthur Antunes Coimbra as compensation for moral damage when he used Zico s image on the doors of toilets in a bar he was operating in Rio de Janeiro In 2009 he was in prison for defaulting on child support payments and in the same year he was sentenced to three and half years in prison and a fine of US 890000 for failure to declare income and tax evasion His sentence was reduced on appeal to two and a half years of community service and of his flaws the fact is that Deputy Romario holds along with another showman Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva aka Clown Tiririca a seat in Brazil s Federal Congress After being elected in Sao Paulo State with the highest national vote Deputy Oliveira was able to fend off accusations of illiteracy by obtaining 30 in a simple test and demonstrating that he could read and write thus keeping his post as a Federal Deputy Still we must assume that Brazilians accept as true that federal politics and the organization of the 2014 FIFA World Cup are in good hands Not all of us are wired for math From now on whenever a kid who gets math anxiety has to sweat through a math test she ll have a real scientific study to back her up According to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine brain function actually differs in people who have math anxiety from those who do nt The study used a series of brain scans conducted on second and thirdgrade students while the children solved addition and subtraction problems What they found was increased activity in regions of the brain associated with fear which led to decreased activity in other parts involved with problemsolving Students with higher math anxiety naturally tended to score lower than their lessanxious peers Vinod Menon PhD the Stanford professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences who led the research summarized the findings The same part of the brain that responds to fearful situations such as seeing a spider or snake also shows a heightened response in children surprising that despite the scientific community s 50plusyearold awareness of math anxiety no one has really done much research on it until now Dr Victor Carrion an expert on the effects of anxiety in children hope that the findings published this month in Psychological Science will improve the educational system for students with math anxiety The results are a significant step toward our understanding of brain function during math anxiety and will influence development of new academic interventions Menon s lab is now looking for new second and thirdgraders for their next study Participants would receive a modest payment for their participation as well as a month of free math tutoring The next question will be how will kids utilize this information in an attempt to avoid taking math tests I only wish this study would have been performed back when I was in high school KITCHENER Five years in Wilfrid Laurier University s faculty of social work is still a relative newcomer to Kitchener s downtown They reached out to the community Monday with the first screening of their 20minute documentary On The Merits of Being a Good Neighbour The film produced by seven secondyear masters of social work students engages community agencies and businesses as it explores the school s original mission and where it is today Many of these students will be working in agencies in the downtown area Those people interviewed are candid about how the campus has integrated This is a snapshot of what we re doing and what we can do better says Ginette Lafreniere professor of social work and the film s faculty producer Ten years ago birds were the main tenants of the Duke Street campus across from Kitchener City Hall The building formerly St Jerome s High School was privately owned and targeted to become a welfare motel was concerned moving in would displace people Moving downtown was controversial How would it change the community Would students and faculty be safe Would their presence further gentrify the community potentially challenging some of the local residents they wanted to help From the outset Fusco said the school should be a good neighbour And Lafreniere wanted to honour this through the documentary which she saw as a message of hope We can do some terrific things in this community We re honoured to be downtown said Lafreniere Revitalization oppression marginalization and working with vulnerable populations This is what we teach our students so why would we want to isolate them from the reality Ian Stumpf of Poverty Makes Us Sick a small directaction lobby group in the downtown attended the screening The film raised some of the questions I had he says Stumpf however was critical that more individual voices from the was used a lot but each time they used it they meant businesses and agencies Shaman Ishak one of the student filmmakers says ethical considerations prevented putting people on camera There are confidentiality issues for community members who may be service users of those organizations that we re working with The University of Windsor has expressed interest in the film as well as a national conference by the Canadian Association of Social Work Education to be hosted by Laurier in May Lafreniere is aware there is room for improvement but was please to hear through the documentary s production that the school has a valued presence within the community This was a catalyst for a renewed sense of partnership between the faculty and the downtown she says Is there room to do more Yes Should Canada bring back the death penalty Should Canada bring back the death penalty Last week letters editor Paul Russell asked if it was time to bring back capital punishment A majority of respondents said yes Here are some of the letters limited to 75 words or less we received Death penalty is not vengeful just fair My 24yearold daughter KellyAnne was murdered by her boyfriend in 2004 He was a controlling angry person I will be at his parole hearing in about six years to see if he has changed He was convicted of seconddegree murder and I would like to see him kept in prison for the rest of his life Capital punishment for sure John Drummond Montreal Some people say the state should nt kill hence their ideological abhorrence to the death penalty Makes no sense when you think of a soldier s job Tori Stafford was just the latest victim of cruelty Like any dregs such depraved individuals are good for nothing but compost if that Unhooded disgust and contempt in my eyes I d be happy to put the noose around their necks and pull the trapdoor Lorne Peasland Victoria Canada should have an automatic death penalty for people convicted of two separate firstdegree murders This would allow us to execute the likes of Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson and avoid executing the wrongfully convicted as no person will ever be wrongfully convicted of two first degree murders that are separated by a reasonable amount of time or space Jeffrey W Tighe Toronto A criminal should not be allowed to enjoy a better quality lifestyle than the victim And in the case of first0degree murder even life in prison presupposes a better lifestyle than that of the deceased and thus the criminal s death is logical Not immoral barbaric or vengeful just fair Juan C Joffre Calgary Bringing back the death penalty is necessary The death penalty is necessary but can be only used for very serious offences and in the most prudent way Chris Qiu Vaughan Ont Capital punishment is necessary in extreme cases especially involving children The despicable murder of Tori Stafford even moved me a former hardnosed cop I would consent to abolishing

penalty for certain crimes Yes And let s have those put to death then donate their organs for transplant Charles Davidson Toronto The main purpose of the death penalty is not justice or retribution or deterrence it is protection of society It is about making sure that the killer does not kill again Pavel Sorokin Vancouver Our permissive society has created an environment of violence and fear marked

capital punishment for criminals such as Paul Bernardo The coldness that these people exhibit while they are on the of their victims shows the lack of regret for their crimes Josh Cranney Courtice Ont Having no morals human predators will eventually kill so society must eliminate them Jail serves no useful purpose as rehab does not work the costs are not warranted Let s have another debate about capital punishment and vote for Tori s Law Charles Steele Vineland Ont We should enact a Young Victims Act and include a provision for state execution when a person under a specified age is raped or murdered Executing psychopaths who prey on our defenceless young would be a catharsis for many of us Frann Harris Richmond Hill Ont Why should society be burdened with keeping Paul Bernardo or Clifford Olsen incarcerated at a cost of 100k a year or whatever for the next 30 or 40 years Not only would execution save taxpayers money it would free up room in prison for other felons Harry Koza Richmond Hill Ont In 1975 and the taxi driver who witnessed the murder MacDonald was convicted of both crimes however after serving only 12 years of what was supposed to be a life sentence he was released on parole Six months later he brutally murdered 21 yearold university student Lynda Shaw If Macdonald was executed for his original crimes Shaw would still be alive today Lee Hanlon Mission BC A person who commits murder such as in the Tori Stafford case has automatically cancelled hisher right to continue to live in a civilized society and should be removed Hank Bangild Port Colborne Ont No as two wrongs do not make a right A government that has a hard time delivering the mail and other basic public services can not be trusted to make decisions pertaining to the taking of a citizen s life The names Truscott Marshall or Milgaard stand testament to this simple truth Bryan Moir Vaughan Ont Capital punishment is not a deterrent and is not be another sorry manifestation of emotional decisionmaking Revenge is like an orgasm brief intense addictive Tyrone Streete Toronto Once someone dies their soul is freed to be born again Therefore giving the death penalty to even the mostdepraved of murderers is still the wrong thing to do These defective examples of humanity should be locked up securely for as long as possible Norbert Kaysser Port Coquitlam BC The state does not have any business killing its citizens A lifetime of incarceration is a suitable living hell A story comes to mind told by Pierre Berton during the abolition debate A foreign sailor was shipwrecked on the English coast and managed to swim ashore where he spied a small village with a gallows outside the jailhouse Thank God he exclaimed I have landed in a Christian country Sigmund Roseth Mississauga Ont The death penalty should not be reinstated in Canada two wrongs do not make a right that have capital punishment Let s look for the root causes of crime Andy Johnson Little Britain Ont The death penalty is society s revenge to try to remove the guilt of failure the failure to value the gift of life the failure to respect the value of others the failure of fellow humans to be a human Keep in mind the Japanese proverb Before you embark on a journey of revenge dig two graves Where do we dig and when do we stop Dennis McMillan Victoria Man s propensity for error whether in law medicine economics politics etc is legion We should be sufficiently humble to acknowledge our fallibilities and not allow for another source of error by revisiting capital punishment Morton Doran Fairmont BC

Watson Toronto I am disgusted by my blood thirsty vengeanceseeking fellow citizens Most jurisdictions have turned away from this barbaric practice If people want to kill someone so badly the penalty should only be applied in name of those so quick to call for death Not in my name or my children s or the rest of this once sane and reasonable country Bruce Van Dieten Toronto Gandalf said it best in Lord of the Rings Many that live deserve death And some that die deserve life Can you give to deal out death in judgment The death penalty might not always be wrong in itself but it s always above our

deserve to be treated with respect and dignity God s mission is to bring salvation to all men and women His salvation is not imposed but reaches us through acts of love mercy and forgiveness that we can carry out Paul Kokoski Hamilton Ont In direct rebuttal to those who say we ca nt afford the death penalty we ca nt afford to continue warehousing murderers As God almighty commanded Gen 96 Whoso sheddeth man s blood by man shall his blood be shed So let s bring back the noose already Vaughn McMillan Calgary The execution of sanctity of life and justice and disobedience to the word of God He the government is God s servant to do you good But if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing The word sword refers to capital punishmentJohn Stefan Obeda London Ont Yea and

execute wrath upon him that doeth evil Gwen Woods Mission BC The Bible states an eye for an eye This ancient simple rule seems to be lost on today s judicial system Let s get the death penalty back on the books where it belongs and justice will be served once again Ian Cuthbert Oakville Ont Explore other options I think the death penalty is in jail and at regular intervals a degree of pain should be inflicted upon the guilty party in equal measure to that inflicted upon the victim In addition the ridiculous possibility of parole in 25 years should be taken off the books Robert G McLachlan St Catharines Ont Paul Bernardo Cody Legebokoff Robert Pick ton and Russell Williams are all living very well at our expense in our penal system Maybe hanging shooting or drugging them to death is a bit brutal So a possible solution is an isolated penal colony for this filth similar to rotting in hell Douglas Maclean Canmore Alta Although I have no objection to the death penalty for child and cop killers and terrorists it seems to me that a better solution would be to have them work for the state for the rest of their lives to repay society for their misdeeds Mining slaves would be a good occupation for them Jonathan Usher Toronto We should Bringing it back allows retributionists to say We re tough on crime And not applying it allows the 26213TOOLONG crowd to say Yes we could but we do

convicted of rape and murder of a child he should have two choices capital punishment or castration and imprisonment MF Stephenson Toronto Never mind the death penalty what s needed is a life penalty making life sentences truly mean life Serial killers should also be given consecutive rather than concurrent sentences In Clifford Olson s case that would have amounted to 275 years for his 11 murders without the possibility of endless parole hearings every two years after the first 25 years EW Bopp Tsawwassen BC We should not endorse capital deterrent for sexual deviants Women have said this for years Val leMaitre Vancouver Unfortunately there was not room in Monday s paper for the following letters When we allow murderers such as Paul Bernardo to continue their lives even incarcerated we devalue the lives of our murdered children We must say that our children s lives when taken are worth more than what we now allow to their murderers We should have the strength of of our convictions and put these murderers to death It is not revenge It is a question of the value and the validation of the child s life Janey Crowe Surrey BC Of course we should bring back the death penalty Of course we should reverse the foolhardy decision by Pierre Trudeau and the hug a thug milksops to abolish the death penalty for murder Of course we should focus our compassion on victims rights rather than criminals rights and wrongs When it is beyond a reasonable doubt Alliston Ont What is the sentence for the family of a murder victim For an attempted murder victim For a victim of rape sexual abuse or incest Life Those who perpetrate horrendous crimes against the innocent thus robbing them of their lives should pay with their own The death penalty is neither an issue of revenge nor vengeance It is ensuring the protection of lawabiding citizens from those who have made the choice to inflict harm Katherine B dard Gloucester Ont It s high time to ask the deathpenalty crybabies which is the most cruellest punishment to die in your sleep lethal injection or spend 25 years behind a 20foot wall and surrounded with sexhungry criminals ready to rape you humiliate you I would prefer to die in my sleep Ed Jurick Montreal Grey is a great colour for suits capital punishment is black and white as in black skirt and a white blouse To ameliorate the mental lifelong suffering of like the Paul Bernardo and Russell Williams should be taken out of society so they can never be given the slightest chance of repeating their horrific deeds Christiaan Jansen Mississauga Ont Those that have complete and total disregard for human life those that would ignore the sanctity of another humans existence relinquish their right to exist Those that would ignore the pleading of a human being before them and continue in their dastardly deed in extinguishing the life of another do not deserve society s compassion Compassion needs to be reserved for the victims Wade Pearson Calgary Murder is an attack on our society so the only appropriate response is the death penalty Those who argue that this penalty will not deter a murderer are quite correct in fact no punishment will act as a deterrent The death penalty is just and final K Pedder Oakville Ont I ll take the yes side in reinstating the death penalty because I do nt believe in using millions of taxpayer dollars vunerable in society especially children Guilt would have to be established beyond all doubt We would nt want a return to the days of stringing a suspected horse thief up to the nearest tree Jim Corder Nanaimo BC Canadians have been regarded around the world as a polite nonassuming hardworking and basically honest people These virtues until the middle of the last century were underpinned with tough laws strictly enforced In 1891 the theft of a hat and coat generated a oneyear sentence of hard labour for a young first offender and capitol punishment did nt end till 1962 Certainly humane changes to rigid laws were justified but the proliferation of lawyers and liberal dogooders has produced in Canada a relaxed moneygenerated system which now favours the guilty at the expense of the victim Betty L Reade Oakville Ont Consistently Canadians have polled for the death penalty for irrefutably guilty murderers who are deemed permanently dangerous to the public Being so identified is the best reason for ve objections that escape or parole wo nt happen need to be reminded that it has happened often and can again Sappy parole boards terrorists gangsters and corrupt conspirators do exist and if incarceration is incompetent justice has vanished Peter M Maclean Kingston Ont It s high time to bring back the death penalty The our constitution is too lenient and merciful for murderers and killers If any person is convicted of murder charges I as a tax payer see no reason as to why my hard earned money be spent on such rogues Such convicted criminals should not be eligible for human rights If these convicts do not care for others why should community and government care for them Firoz Khan Toronto Yes The death penalty is not revenge it is the only fitting punishment for premeditated murder serial killing raping and killing a child killing a police officer etc The case of Clifford Olsen was particularly disturbing as he was able to The death penalty would have prevented this and would have brought final closure to the families of the victims Renate Roy Toronto The answer is a resounding YES for all cases where the crime has been deliberate and planned also in cases where there has been no premeditation but there has existed deliberation ie the defendant has used force or means that plain common sense identifies them as deadcausing All of this of course subject to the perpetrator having been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt The individual who wantonly takes someone s life automatically forfeits the right to his or her own This principle if applied makes citizens feel protected because legal retribution conveys a sense of fairness since the State values their lives Luis J G mez Montreal For heinous crimes that are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt Capital Punishment should be reinstated A jury today examining the facts judiciously coupled with modern technology would could determine guilt innocence All politicians Parliamentarians should listen to their constituents set aside their political expediency to reinstate the Death Penalty Peter K Marchant Pickering Ont There is one and only one good reason for the death penalty The murderer executed is absolutely definitely deterred from being able to kill again Six percent of murderers kill again Many innocent lives would be saved children pensioners and even prisoners in jail Stephen Ottridge Vancouver The death penalty for deliberate murder is morally acceptable and I think all reasonable practical objections to its use can be met satisfactorily But I do nt think capital punishment is morally required and I know that a large minority of my fellow Canadians find it morally repugnant It will alienate the minority from their own community if the majority rules on this one We best agree on a suitable alternative punishment GG Brown Waterloo ON Absolutely when things have reached the point where even the accused has boldly admitted having murdered IT IS time by catering to these animals by keeping them alive in a dysfunctional correctional system Brian Kinnon Alliston Ont I am prochoice on execution convinced that a state should retain this option for dealing with the worst types of indubitably guilty criminals Canada s prolife policy on extraditing foreign murderers who flee here often obstructs justice And many who oppose execution regardless of circumstances seem to lack empathy for the families of murder victims while failing to recognize that some imprisoned hardened killers manage to murder and traumatize again Dan Sonnenschein Vancouver The death penalty will save the public the expense of taking care of the twisted evil doers for the next 25 years It will eliminate some of the pain amp suffering of family and friends by removing the perpatrators from this world it will lessen some of the constant reminders amp constant torment that the guilty parties very existence causes D McColl Hamilton Ont Truly guilty murderers should be executed woman executed by the US government was Mary Surratt I was inspired to write a book about her controversial hanging and the Lincoln assassination plot by Canada s bestselling author of all time Charles Chiniquy Abraham Lincoln s extremely close friend who wrote of her trial and execution Paul Serup Prince George BC I am in favour of capital punishment Having been a police officer for 36 years and having seen too much of the handiwork of Canadian criminals I believe those having committed first degree murder should be executed Those found guilty would have ten years and no more to exhaust their appeals and this would give time for any evidence even incontrovertible DNA evidence to be presented to clear them The recidivism would be zero Gary Godwin Prince George BC In this debate I turn to the words of JRR Tolkien Many that live deserve death And some die that deserve life Can you give it to them Then be not too eager to deal out own safety Even the wise can not see all ends Alex Banks Toronto Those who oppose the death penalty on the grounds that innocent people might be executed are overlooking the fact that since it was abolished over 800 innocent people have died at the hands of killers who were released escaped or paroled It may not be a deterrent but its an effective preventive measure Woody Woodrow Kelowna BC Yes Against those in power who egregiously abuse their position and thereby undermine the public trust in the authorities Say a police chief also turns out to be working for organized crime Or cops covering up crime by other police such as hiding the video evidence in the Robert Dziekanski case Or a spy chief passing info to the enemy Vilmos Soti North Vancouver BC I have always been in favour of the death penalty I strongly believe that there would be less crime because not only would we get rid of repeat offenders future acts knowing they could lose their life Furthermore tax money now being used to support prisoners for many years behind bars could instead be allocated to much better causes in our society such as environment health and education Monica Cowan Calgary Reintroducing capital punishment to Canada represents a step backwards for our legal system Condemning a criminal to death row has proven to be an inaccurate science where the validity of the conviction is never absolute In addition to being an expensive alternative to incarceration it fails to act as a sustainable mechanism to deter future criminal activity More attention and correctional resources should be devoted to the rehabilitation of criminals instead of towards their death Roger Hilton Montreal The sadistic treatment meted out to Tori Stafford is the reason for the death penalty debate If it were brought back I shudder to contemplate the fate of the innocent people who were found guilty by bogus evidence of pathologist Dr Charles Smith Elwan LoboPires Mississauga Ont Mot only is it unethical but the cost is ridiculous A lengthy and expensive series of trials would be necessary for each case to ensure the verdict of guilty is definite on top of the cost to actually administer the execution Sid Kelly Bowmanville Ont The moral argument for capital punishment is simple If you take another s life you forfeit your own The legal argument is more difficult because juries make mistakes as do judges Witnesses lie and then recant Police fabricate evidence I do not wish to live in a country where the state has the legal right to execute its citizens It is better that the prison system is full than one innocent person be put to death Keith Brady Empress Alta While the execution of monsters may satisfy a certain segment of society such a solution is shortsighted since those who are dead are beyond suffering Better they be kept alive but in conditions so unspeakably abysmal that even Papillon would be aghast Let the very long time to come No to the death penalty death is too easy an escape Mark Lavoie Toronto Capital Punishment must never be reinstated Apart from the injunction Thou shalt not kill there is always a risk of putting to death an innocent person What if 14yearold Stephen Truscott had been hanged after that travesty of a trial according to the sentence laid down by the presiding judge There have been too many examples of executing innocent persons Whatever the cost incarceration for life is our only choice Mary McKim London Ont While I m agnostic about the whole capital punishment issue I have relatives who make some fair points One says we need it because some people just do nt learn without it Another wonders why if capital punishment is not needed we still need the term repeat offender Grant A Brown Edmonton I totally disagree with the retrograde step of reintroducing the death penalty What I of 25 years a true life sentence for certain crimes that are so horrendous as to turn ones stomach just reading about them These people should never be allowed to walk the streets again Ann Meiring Calgary The death penalty does prevent repeat crimes but unfortunately does not prevent the injustice of executing the person who is not guiltyWe have had several prominent examples of people wrongfully imprisoned for capital offenses who were later proven innocent Particularly heinous crimes should instead lead to life imprisonment without parole and mean exactly that imprisonment until death Leigh U Smith Burnaby BC It is time to bring back the death penalty for brutal murderers like the ones who killed Tori Stafford We should ask ourselves if people like Clifford Olson or Paul Bernardo deserve to live at our expense Chuck Spencer Bayfield Ont Today you ca nt go outside for a walk without being afraid that someone will pull you into the bushes mug rape and even kill you And it is worse when this scum on Earth get away with this Rosi Bisaro Hamilton Ont Canada should have never stop doing capital punishment Having no deterrent to replace it was just naive Simha S Mendelsohn Toronto It s time to bring back the death penalty for kidnappers killers and rapists especially for crimes involving young girls and boys War and self defence are legitimate excuses for the taking of human life and it should be also for murderers who fiendishly kill our most vulnerable Patrick Rosati Montreal The death penalty is an effective crime deterrent in many instances especially with crimes where the guilty has shown he is beyond any redemptive potential and needs to be put out of his own misery The ideals of rehabilitation and recovery have serious limitations Cyril Abraham Whitby Ont The Harper government should hold a national referendum on capital punishment as soon as possible as it is the proper punishment for perpetrators of terrible crimes such as what happened to Moore is nt a stupid man But he appears to assume that the public the media and many of his Conservative supporters are stupid This may be why he gets away with calling people far far left when sometimes they re only a couple of shades more progressive than he might be The real extremists in this country are Conservative politicians who reject the science on supervisedinjection sites climate change crime and in some cases even evolution I actually do nt believe that Moore is as ideologically objectionable as some of his colleagues He s not an opponent of samesex marriage and he seems to appreciate the arts even if he ca nt always convince his colleagues to offer sufficient funding In this regard Moore reminds me of BC aboriginal relations minister Mary Polak As chair of the Surrey school board she argued in favour of a ban on books about samesex parents even though she was nt a holy roller unlike most has become his party s greatest polemicist which is why he s increasingly being called upon to smear his opponents It s a shameful legacy that he s creating for himself Former Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater once famously said Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice In the case of Moore perhaps we should change the wording to read Redbaiting in the defence of extremism is a vice And James Moore you re guilty as charged Comments 9 Comments glen

have a majority that they think allows them to be arrogant and divisive The far far left as he puts it is also Canadian also worked to make this country great and most important allowed people like Moore to get elected and at 215pm Moore may not be stupid but we should nt assume he s smart enough to know better He belongs to and actively supports a reactionary party From the warped vantage point of that party s adherents anyone to the left of Stockwell Day is either a socialist or a fellowtraveller DavidH Mar 26 2012 at 223pm Charlie Smith wrote Moore is nt a stupid man Ummm do you have empirical evidence to support that statement In the absence of such empirical evidence I think we should all assume that he is in fact stupid Just look at what he does for a living whom he does it for and what he actually said after the NDP convention Sometimes a person who acts like a fool walks like a fool and quacks like a fool is just a fool Kent Mar 26 2012 at 824pm Not hard to tell what side of the political spectrum you are on brain and what is best for Canada Let me give you a hint it is nt tax and spend like a drunken sailor We do nt need bigger government run by people who feel they are owed a living and feel that the rich amp corporations do nt pay enough That is getting very old We need a government that is cautious about spending my tax dollars because we the tax paying public deserve a fiscallyresponsible government bobo Mar 27 2012 at 1156am Actually Charlie the real extremists in this are the left wing tax sucking types who think that everything should be given to them for free without considering the source or the effort to make it possible People who think that they are entitled to something just for being born Sorry there is nothing in this world that does nt require some personal effort and responsibility Funny how the left keeps saying they are for helping others when what they really mean is they for helping only themselves and those who believe their of defending extremism just as you accuse Minister Moore of And that s really my point The left wing extremist are just like the right wing extremist The true path and most of Canada lies somewhere in

disrupted the massive star may have turned it inside out in the process Using very long observations of Cassiopeia A or Cas A a team of scientists has mapped the distribution of elements in the supernova remnant in unprecedented detail This information shows where the different layers of the presupernova star are located 300 years after the explosion and provides insight into the nature of the supernova An artist s illustration showed a simplified picture of the inner layers of the star that formed Cas A just before it exploded with the predominant concentrations of different elements

the same colour scheme to show the distribution of iron sulphur and magnesium in the supernova remnant The data show that the distributions of sulphur and silicon are similar as are the distributions of magnesium and neon Oxygen which according to theoretical models is the most abundant element in the remnant is difficult to detect because the Xray emission characteristic of oxygen ions is strongly absorbed by gas in along the line of sight to Cas A and because almost all the oxygen ions have had all their electrons stripped away A comparison of the illustration and the Chandra element

supernova remnant resulting from the explosion of a massive star It is based on a million seconds of Chandra observing time Tallying up what they see amount of Xray emitting debris has a mass just

the issue itself is not bad enough the MSHRC finds itself in a limbo two of its members have retired and replacements have yet to be found The chairperson quit a few weeks ago and there is no indication of a quick replacement That is why there is no action in the MSHRC right now leave alone any dramatics Neither is there a sense of urgency in filling up the vacancies So what do the few officers who remain do They carry out research not an insignificant activity but not incredibly important to a functional Commission They operate in the Commission s office a singlestoreyed asbestosroofed building near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus It has a comforting anonymity Since 2001 numerous complaints of custodial deaths have been brought before the MSHRC each year the lowest being 87 in the first year going up to 250 in later years That is a poor index of police attitude towards the citizens We do nt know the trend in the year that is concluding yet but according to unnamed officials quoted by the Indian Express on Thursday nearly 70 percent of the cases brought to the MSHRC are of this nature The first crisis came when Kshitij Vyas a former High Court Chief Justice quit suddenly and moved back to Gujarat Then came two quick retirements one of TS Singarvel and another of retired justice VG Munshi There are two ways in which vacancies arise one by sudden resignations which adversely impact the Commission and the other by retirements which are foretold But the Maharashtra Government did not foresee the retirements It waited till the officers retired and then sent the to give a nod The choice of chairperson is yet to be made According to the Indian Express the panel that picks the chairperson comprising the chief minister home minister speaker of

highhandedness of the state or its instruments only to be turned away It is their only grievance redress mechanism That itself could be a violation Perhaps it is If things worked according to law and humans got the basic minimum respect because of them then the Commission would not have been required at all But given the number of complaints against the Maharashtra police The Commission s raison

puzzler seeing you rotating track segments in order to keep various trains running smoothly and headed towards their destinations It s immaculately and cutely presented and just about the only negative I can throw at it is that the levels get very hard very quickly if you have a quick enough mind and quicker fingers then Traintiles is a mustbuy From splash screen to About screen it s clear that Traintiles has been something of a labour of love by the developers Atmospheric attractive Traintiles has a similar overall arc to Angry Birds the now well established packs of levels set in different parts of the world gradually getting unlocked as you progress Curiously only part of each area has to be solved though this does happily get round the situation where you re area until you get past the problem one The idea in Traintiles is that the track is made up of straight and curved and crossroad pieces arranged on a grid Tapping a track piece rotates it as shown in the first of several tutorial animations below As you might expect the first few levels are easy introducing the track pieces and ways in which you ll need to rotate them in real time but things quickly get much harder Multiple trains running at the same time to multiple destinations as shown below It soon becomes apparent that most central pieces of track need to be used several times per level in different configurations usually with some split second timing to switch a curved section a split second after one train has used it and just before the next train needs it to go in a different direction Add in more and more trains Add in the possibility or in the case of the puzzle designer Add in ever more complex layouts and you can see where all this is going Classic game territory that s where As with other arcade puzzlers eg Flight Control there s a Oh heck here comes another train I m still juggling two others as it is degree of increasing freneticism plus the enticing sight of a replay retry icon when you fail Surely I ll get it right this time etc Within each level pack you do have to solve every puzzle in order to unlock the next one but a you can go back and replay earlier easier levels if you want to remind yourself of some of the techniques that got you so far and b as mentioned earlier other level packs get unlocked before you ve finished the current one so you can simply jump packs for an easy change of scenery Talking of scenery it s immaculate here Around the central used trees wave gently in the wind birds fly overhead and more All this graphical action has meant

evidence of pollution and that there was oil on the water surface and a chemical smell in the air Air and water samples are being sent for analysis at a German laboratory to find out what is creating the sheen on the surface Mr Bussau added Although we are five kilometres away we can feel here that this is contaminating and polluting the environment and this is dangerous for the environment and for the climate But a spokesman from the platform operator Total said The only confirmation that we have had of anything resembling an oil slick is a sheen of gas condensate He added that this condensate was a light hydrocarbon similar to petrol and was expected to dissipate naturally either evaporating due to warmer weather or through wave action Danger The leak from the Elgin rig from that and surrounding oil and gas platforms Meanwhile the French oil giant has further delayed plans to fly engineers to stem the 11day leak of explosive gas This is due to continuing adverse weather conditions in the area a company spokesman said yesterday Strong winds are reportedly blowing the gas cloud towards the spot where a helicopter carrying the team of crisis engineers would land pushing relief efforts back to today or Friday The wind direction was initially forecast by the UK s Met Office to change by yesterday evening and through this morning It would have blown gas away from the landing point and allowed a team of eight experts to assess the steps needed to stop the large and potentially explosive leak The company which has calculated that the leak is costing it 16million a day said on Tuesday that the team of engineers would assess conditions on the platform and find out whether a socalled well kill was feasible This would involve finding out whether any necessary Another more expensive option also being pursued is to dig two relief wells to the source of the gas at 4000 metres depth far below the sea bed Experts have said that can take up to six months to complete Total says it will push up daily costs to more than 2million Total s share prices have dropped by 65 per cent since the leak was reported last week knocking billions of pounds off its value The company said the team of engineers would consist of staff from Total and US specialist company Wild Well Control Firefighters and engineers working for the Houstonbased company are experts at disasters such as oil rig explosions and have been dubbed Hellfighters by Hollywood Yesterday an offshore worker told of being one of the last men left on board the North Sea platform after the gas leak was first detected on March 25 William Cardno was one of the 19 men who stayed on board the Elgin platform to monitor the situation flights He said When the first alarm was sounded we had the helicopter onscene within one hour And within an hour after that we had 107 people evacuated An hour after that we had the full 220 people evacuated We deliberately kept 19 people on board the platform to evaluate the situation and to see if there was anything we could do and really to maintain the systems Closeup Greenpeace say that the Total rig has a large gas cloud surrounding it and has left a condensed gas slick on the water Mr Cardino added If we had any escalation at all on the platform we were absolutely confident we could have been off the platform in five minutes by lifeboat We all practised our lifeboat drill and we checked the lifeboat and strapped ourselves into it I think this demonstrated that our procedures are good and our process is good Although we never want these things to happen when it does happen our paramount priority The gas leak is spewing an estimated 200000 cubic metres of natural gas from beneath the evacuated platform into the air per day forming a highly explosive gas cloud Double Cross The True Story of the DDay Spies By Ben Macintyre After the Second World War a Catalan former chickenfarmer named Juan Pujol retired to Venezuela where he taught Spanish to Shell staff and ran a bookshop This literary destiny seems more than apt Between 1942 and 1945 while living in a nondescript semi in Hendon with a disgruntled wife and a dull cover job at the BBC Pujol Agent Garbo to his real controllers at MI5 contributed several decisive chapters to perhaps the most spectacularly effective work of fiction in modern history Together with his doubleagent colleagues some of whose stories Ben Macintyre weaves into the latest of his enjoyable and engrossing books about wartime subterfuge and deception Garbo fashioned a limitless multicharacter everexpanding novel It was designed to deceive the Germans about every aspect of the preparations for DDay From 1942 every German source in Britain worked for the Allies with the bizarre multinational band of Double its dry cricketfanatic chief John Masterman By June 1944 when the doublecrossers achieved what Macintyre calls their worldchanging triumph Operation Fortitude had managed to persuade the German high command that the Normandy landings were merely a starter before the main course That the Wehrmacht believed with unshakeable conviction would take the form of a massive invasion of the Pas de Calais across the narrowest point of the Channel by an entirely fictional First US Army Group under General Patton with sideorder attacks aimed at Norway and the Atlantic coast around Bordeaux Did this intricate tissue of fibs help to win the war The military evidence looks compelling A month after DDay 22 German divisions were still held back from the Normandy front An order to move the formidable 1st Panzer Division there was rescinded specifically because Garbo in his florid rococo despatches warned that Normandy would be a diversion Some historians remain sceptical about the value of Second World War deception Eastern Front crumbling and the German officer elite in nearopen revolt against Hitler the DDay forces would have prevailed without the rich diet of disinformation fed to Berlin by the agents Writers about espionage Macintyre included feel a natural affinity for keyboard warriors who spin colourful yarns that command assent and tend to overegg their tasty pudding In spite of these caveats Garbo and his deeply eccentric colleagues undoubtedly saved countless lives In his history of DDay the levelheaded Antony Beevor writes that Fortitude proved more effective than the Alllies had ever dared imagine Macintyre s gripping yarns may bring no major revisions to our map of the secret war Joshua Levine s book on Fortitude appeared only last year But they do show with captivating panache the debt that Allied victory owed to these oddball storytellers who wove around the actual army that liberated Europe a bodyguard of lies In addition to Garbo Macintyre traces the flights of fantasy foisted on their German handlers by Dusko Popov by Elvira de la Fuente Chaudoir Bronx the bisexual Peruvian socialite and gambler by Lily Sergeyev Treasure the volatile FrenchRussian agent who almost scuppered Fortitude because the British terminated her beloved dog Babs and by the Polish undercover specialist Roman Czerniawski Brutus a tough pro among this cast of highmaintenance amateur primadonnas But did the Abwehr German military intelligence really swallow all the fabrications that MI5 s shadow warriors fed them prudently mixed with nonessential truth As Macintyre s tale unfolds we come to ask how much this notoriously disloyal weak link in the Nazi chain tacitly connived in strategic blunders that would hasten the downfall of the Reich Messages intercepted at Bletchley Park by the Enigma codebreakers prove that Garbo and friends apparently retained their kudos and credibility until DDay and beyond However a suspicion remains that antiNazi officers right up to Alexis von Roenne who digested and presented intelligence for Hitler had rumbled the Double Cross its splendidly weird ploys and feints spypigeons figure frequently Macintyre s book culminates in a stirring account of oldfashioned courage Worldly cynical dissolute the German caseofficer Johnny Jebsen Popov s handler was a louche playboy highsociety fraudster and PG Wodehouse fan Always covertly antiNazi he had been turned by MI5 in 1943 In April 1944 Jebsen was kidnapped in Lisbon and spirited to Berlin It seems that antiHitler officers feared he might unwittingly derail their plans to kill the F hrer Once in the capital though proregime interrogators took charge He was taken to the Gestapo prison On the eve of DDay Jebsen whom everyone assumed would instantly crack and squeal could have wrecked Fortitude Yet reduced by weeks of torture and maltreatment to a justliving skeleton he said not a single word Macintyre salutes the astonishing bravery of a hedonistturnedhero And this ramifying network of improbable often comic fraud and fiction reaches its fitting broken in body but not in spirit who clung at death s door to the Code of the Woosters Never let a pal down Police in crisis after flood of racism complaints The Metropolitan police are now facing allegations of racism abuse and violence involving at least fifteen officers Getty Images The Metropolitan Police has revealed new allegations of racist abuse bullying and violence involving at least 15 of its officers threatening a return to the crisis that saw the force branded institutionally racist more than a decade ago The Met referred eight new cases to the police watchdog as part of a hasty review which was ordered after a recording emerged of an officer calling a 21yearold black man a nigger as he was being arrested after last summer s riots Senior officers are scrambling to stamp out the crisis and prevent a repeat of the years of soulsearching that followed the Macpherson inquiry s damning report on the investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence in Eltham southeast London in 1993 The revelations also raise questions about the role of the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC which is being New allegations against police that came to light yesterday included A racist attack against several youths in Hyde Park in 2011 which involved five police officers all of whom remain on full duties Mishandling of calls with a racial element by a PC in the force s central communication command in 2010 Claims that a group of officers in Newham east London used racist language Three have been suspended Racist bullying by police and civilian staff against community support officers over an 18month period Two police officers have been suspended We re just glad that what we have seen for a long time has come out Estelle du Boulay the director of the Newham Monitoring Project told The Independent last night It s a typical picture for us The 10 cases which have come to light in the past week include an alleged attack on a 15yearold boy in the custody suite at an east London police station commissioner Craig Mackey who led the review said there could be more referrals to the IPCC in the future Six of the new cases involved officers blowing the whistle on colleagues which Mr Mackey said showed the prevailing attitude in the force Details of the new allegations which apparently date back to 2010 emerged two days after the head of the Metropolitan Police Bernard HoganHowe made an appeal to staff to report any racist colleagues The commissioner made it clear after the first alleged incident came to light last weekend that we take the issue of racism extremely seriously Mr Mackey said I want to reiterate there is no room for racism in the Met Mr Mackey who said the force had been working closely with the IPCC during the review said the watchdog had agreed to look again at four cases but was not able to say why In a statement the IPCC contradicted the claims made by the Met Police and we will assess each case on its merits and make a decision regarding the level of IPCC involvement needed At this stage the IPCC has not agreed to investigate any of these latest referrals it said The Macpherson Inquiry led to a huge change in British policing after its damning report into the failure of police to convict anyone for the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 Two members of the racist white gang which stabbed the teenager to death were finally convicted earlier this year following a breakthrough in forensic science However one of the panel members on the Macpherson Inquiry team Dr Richard Stone told The Independent that he still considered the force to be institutionally racist Riot victim s father Tariq Jahan guilty of attack charge A man who called for calm after his son died in the Birmingham riots has been found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm in an earlier attack Tariq Jahan broke a man s jaw when he punched him last July in Handsworth Jahan 46 told Birmingham Crown Court he acted in self defence and was cleared of causing GBH with intent The judge said Jahan deserved to be sent to jail but gave him a suspended sentence owing to his public appeal for calm during the August riots Extraordinary position Jahan s son Haroon was one of three men who died in Winson Green during the riots in Birmingham Sentencing judge William Davis QC said People who break people s jaws in this kind of mindless violence normally go to prison but I take a view that because of his extraordinary position it is right to suspend sentence Jahan was given a 12month sentence suspended for hours unpaid service and to pay 1000 compensation to Sajjad Ali the man he punched The court heard how Jahan had been driving along Factory Road in July and had beeped his horn at a van blocking his route Headbutting claim Mr Ali 34 had been standing by the roadside speaking to the van driver and mouthed something aggressively to Jahan who was accompanied by his wife Jahan told the jury he got out of the car to speak to Mr Ali to try to resolve the situation He then admitted hitting Mr Ali who he claimed had headbutted him first Mr Ali disputed that version of events He claimed Jahan became aggressive because he accused Mr Ali of staring at his wife Mr Ali told the court Jahan said Oi why you staring at me before he climbed out of his car and accused him of staring at my missus Mr Ali s jaw was fractured in two places and he said Jahan must have used moderate to severe force to inflict those injuries Jurors on Thursday accepted that Jahan s did not intend to seriously harm Mr Ali on 6 July 2011 Genuine public service A month later Jahan s 21yearold son Haroon and two friends brothers Shazad Ali 30 and Abdul Musavir 31 were struck by a car during disorder in Winson Green as riots spread across England All three were declared dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters Within hours of Haroon s death Jahan addressed a group of youths outside his home and appealed for them to calm down end the disorder and go home Addressing Jahan directly on Thursday the judge said his actions in August were a genuine public service He said in the aftermath of his son s death Jahan s actions probably prevented really serious disorder continuing in Birmingham He told Jahan of events For that reason and that reason alone I can suspend the sentence A huge rock carving in memory of Kim Ilsung the father of North Korea has been unveiled as the impoverished country prepared a lavish celebration of this month s 100th anniversary of his birth The inscription covering a length of 122 feet was hewn into a natural rock face near Pakyon Falls in Kaesong city near the border with South Korea the official news agency said The message Our eternal leader Comrade Kim Ilsung Dedicated to the centenary of the birth of the leader April 15 Juche 101 2012 is an immortal monument which will always shine along with the Songun era the news agency said Songun is North Korea s militaryfirst policy Kim Ilsung died in 1994 and handed power to his son Kim Jongil who died last December after bequeathing the leadership to his own son Kim Jongun North Korea which fosters a massive personality cult surrounding the Kims has inscribed messages praising the dynasty Brands that have stood the test of time What do CocaCola Cadbury Levi Strauss amp Co Volkswagen KFC Marlboro cigarettes and Mrs Balls Chutney all have in common They all have lived through at least one World War the rise and fall of Communism the flower power 60 s the first man on the moon bad hair of the 1980s and not to forget the most recent financial crisis None of these brands is an absolute physical necessity yet these brands have always been a part of our lives and do nt seem to be going anywhere If you take time to consider some of the great brands that have always been around they pretty much still look the same taste the same and feel the same For example in the 1920s Marlboro the world s largest selling cigarette brand initially targeted female smokers with their Mild as May tagline and feminine focussed advertising In the 1950s they changed but since then very little has changed to the Marlboro brand That s over 60 years with still the same cowboy Marlboro Man product and packaging 60 years of success without much radical change is rather astounding The great brands that have been around for many generations have all stuck to their brand values and personality They ve been consistent while adapting and refreshing themselves as consumers and market conditions have changed but all have done so without comprising their core brand essence Take CocaCola for instance from 1886 to 2005 the famous beverage brand has had 168 different taglines yet their brand positioning has remained fairly consistent As the saying goes If it ai nt broke do nt fix it CocaCola learnt this the hard way when introducing New Coke in 1985 a reformulation of the product with a campaign slogan of The new taste of CocaCola New Coke attracted great consumer backlash and subsequently led to the reintroduction of the original learn from the good old favourites like CocaCola Marlboro and the others I have mentioned Firstly ruthless consistency over time pays Cadbury has always stuck with their signature purple and consistently market their glass and a half of milk in each chocolate Similarly Volkswagen has constantly focussed on people KFC has the ever present Colonel Sanders and special 11 herbs and spices recipe consistently applied to the marketing campaigns Consistency is critical to ingrain your position and message to customers When a company product or service is unpredictable or confusing the reputation of a brand becomes questionable and simply can not build momentum Next rather refresh than radically change People fall in love with a particular brand for a specific reason whether it is what the brand stands for its personality its product or service offering or the message it sends out Like a person if any of these characteristics change fundamentally the brand can lose its integrity and subsequently its fans jeanswear brand with a brand essence that has remained fairly consistent over the decades Yet when Levi s discovered that a large proportion of women were unsatisfied with how jeans fitted or rather did nt fit their allimportant derri re they quickly responded with the Levi s EVA range that was designed especially for ladies with a few more curves They did this without compromising their classic heritage or completely overhauling their product range A refresh from time to time is essential to stay abreast of market trends and to avoid complacency In 1991 Kentucky Fried Chicken refreshed their branding and name to KFC taking into account that people were opting for healthier methods of cooking and therefore chose to focus less on the Fried in their name Finally do nt underestimate the power of your product or service in building and maintaining a strong brand No brand will last over time if the product and the value associated with it is not up to scratch The strength of Mrs Balls competitor locally or from aboard can even try replicate or improve the taste and flavour of this South African favourite The reliability of the product is solid and thus the power of the brand is undeniable Though many of the famous brands may not be necessities or items that guarantee our physical wellbeing they still are cherished and loved throughout the world Through careful brand management these great brands have made us smile satisfied our cravings brought people together and most importantly have been dependable They ve been around before most of us were born and will most likely be around for many years still to come they ve truly

was put on a socalled sluts list that went viral on Facebook and BlackBerry Messenger She found her name was on the list last month and tried to overdose by drinking a cocktail of household detergents and petrol The girl recovered in hospital and was discharged four days later This is yet another example of cyberbullying in schools In January a 15yearold Gauteng schoolgirl was harassed by four fellow pupils It is alleged they mocked her called her fat and threw diet pills at her They then went on to Facebook and BlackBerry s BBM chat service making a series of threats and nasty comments And if that was not enough they allegedly hit her over the head with a glass bottle The assault was filmed by another pupil allegedly at the attacker s back at school a week later The mother of the victim who may not be named filed a complaint of assault with the police She said she was angry because the school had not told her the alleged attacker would be back at school She said her daughter had been friends with the group but they had drifted apart and that s when the cyberbullying began In the Durban incident the list was started earlier this year by an anonymous person who using the BBM service gave the names and details of 10 teenage girls from Wentworth As the list went viral and was passed from one user to the next more names were added to it They need to go to their nearest police station where they must open a case of crimen injuria We have not received any reports but if we do we will investigate he said Commenting on the Gauteng incident Izabella LittleGates an internationally published author and parenting that is escalating and should be taken seriously It has to be addressed and parents must discuss it with their children In the weeks following the incident psychologists and experts said cyberbullying was underreported and the country would see more cases as access to technology increased A study on cyber aggression was carried out among young people in four provinces by the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention in 2009 The research found that just under half the 1 726 youngsters interviewed had been victims of cyber aggression One in three had been a victim of cyber aggression at school and 42 percent had experienced it outside school In the survey a quarter of the youngsters said they had experienced bullying by SMS One in five admitted to having bullied someone else by SMS According to the survey findings nearly 70 percent of those who had bullied others by SMS had themselves been bullied In order of frequency voice calls SMSes instant messages used in the bullying The problem of bullying whether cyber or conventional has attracted the attention of one of the world s entertainment stars Pop diva Lady Gaga recently took her star power and some of her famous friends including Oprah Winfrey to Harvard University in the US to launch a foundation aimed at empowering young people and stamping out bullying If you have revolutionary potential you must make the world a better place and use it Gaga said as she launched the Born this Way Foundation named after her 2011 hit album and single This is about transformative change in culture The singer has often been a voice for people she believes lack representation in the media and she formed the foundation to address issues like selfconfidence wellbeing bullying and the need for mentoring I believe that humankind as a whole can change the world said Gaga The goal is to challenge meanness and cruelty their communities Winfrey said she had joined forces with Gaga s foundation because it shared some of her core beliefs including the need to show kindness compassion and care for others Gaga said the three pillars of her foundation were to promote safety skills and opportunities for young people Once you feel safe in your environment and you acquire the skills to be a loving accepting tolerant person the opportunities are endless to be a functioning human in society Gaga s foundation is expected to include specific outreach to young lesbians and gays Born This Way quickly became an unofficial anthem for gay empowerment and pride The singer said that releasing the song had helped propel the dialogue between her and her fans which had became a calling of sorts After I put the song out the conversation ignited even further I never wanted this conversation to end I thought how I could keep it going And if anyone knows me Gaga has also put her Born Brave Bus on the road as a kind of dropin centre for young people The more kids that I can get to come and eat hamburgers and talk outside my shows the better I feel that it will start small but over time will be very big She knew there was no one answer or single law that could be passed to stop bullying and hatred or to mandate acceptance Gaga said I wish there was because you know I would be chained naked to a fence to try to get one passed Staff Reporters and Reuters Latecomer pupils locked out of school INLSALOCKED OUT Pupils of Orient Islamic School gather outside the schools gates after they were denied access for arriving late Picture Sbonelo Ngcobo The new school term started badly for some pupils at Durban s Orient Islamic School on Tuesday they were locked out for arriving minutes after the bell had sounded Their parents were left fuming after they were forced to return to the Centenary Road school to pick up their children but school authorities defended the move saying parents had been warned of the new lockout policy Fathima Padia said she and her daughter had arrived at the school at 733am three minutes after the bell summoning the children to their classrooms had sounded When I got home I received a call from my daughter telling me to pick her up she said They usually left home at 710am to be at school by 720am she said but on Tuesday they left five minutes late a set of traffic lights we had to pass through was nt working Padia said that when she arrived at the school she found that about 50 children were clustered at the entrance The children were not being allowed inside the premises and were standing around not knowing what to do she said Instructions The children waited about 90 minutes before the school s security received instructions to let the children in but only long enough to contact their parents so they could be sent home The school has a no cellphones policy but thankfully my daughter had her phone with her Padia said If she had nt I do nt know how she would have contacted me She claimed there was no adult supervision at the school gates and she had feared for the safety of the pupils some of whom were as young as 14 When the Daily News arrived at the school on Tuesday morning Padia was One pupil said people walking past had been asking them for cigarettes and trying to engage in conversation We do nt feel safe she said Javed Aswani whose sister is a pupil at the school said that while he agreed with the school s policy of sending latecomers home he wanted the school at least to keep them somewhere safe while they waited for their parents My sister is in Grade 8 and she had to wait outside for more than an hour he said She is the responsibility of the school when she s at school What if something happened What if she was kidnapped or robbed In June last year in a circular issued by the KwaZuluNatal Department of Education officials noted with great concern the number of pupils coming to school late The circular instructed principals to close the gates after classes or assembly had started and to record the names of latecomers and phone their parents be locked out or turned away from school High priority Orient Islamic School principal Ebrahim Ansur said yesterday that the school placed a high priority on the inculcation of discipline in pupils Having observed an increase in the incidence of latecoming during the first term the school notified parents at the end of the term that as from April 10 this year a lockout policy would be implemented for all latecomers he said Parents were reminded about this policy via SMS on Monday April 9 Ansur said about 30 pupils were locked out for arriving after 730am with several taken back home by their parents Those pupils who were left by their parents he said were at the school gates which were manned by the school s security personnel whose task it was to ensure the safety of the pupils These learners were subsequently allowed into the school premises The school contacted the parents of these learners to fetch their children from greatly encouraged by the excellent cooperation we have received from our parents and learners as evidenced by the fact that out of a school population of 1 200 learners there were comparatively few latecomers Ansur said Daily News Comment Guidelines Has a comment offended you Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the righthand side Click triangle and select

an interesting narrative emerging in South Africa s general societal discourse and it s connected to the phenomenon of corruption The narrative makes a comparison between the corruption and servicedelivery failures of postapartheid governance and the efficiency of the apartheid state By the end of last protests since the beginning of March violent protests whose beginnings can be traced back to 2004 most of which were staged in predominantly black areas Each of these protests pointing to corruption municipal incompetence and other forms of ineptitude At the end of 2011 the head of the Special Investigations Unit SIU Willie Hofmeyer reported that between R25 R30billion had been embezzled or misappropriated in one way or the other in the last financial year through some form of incompetence or corruption What is worse is that the Treasury concurred with Hofmeyrs s findings Enough money to pay for the etoll debt and then some The many anticorruption agencies units and departments in the various organs of state are not short of casefiles which point to runaway and endemic corruption in the country These units are themselves in a real sense an example of fruitless expenditure because they are not an essential line function aimed at the direct alleviation of poverty or betterment of people s lives but a grudge purchase no way exempts the private sector from the same indictment One would be naive to think that the private sector is a beacon of ethical corporate behaviour competence and efficiency Even as you read this column there are enquiries into allegations of corruption in the business activities of one of our major cellphone companies in a certain Middle Eastern country As the saying goes it takes two to tango For every example of state corruption there is direct or indirect corresponding private sector complicity What is more infuriating about state corruption in all its forms though is that it is taxpayer s funds entrusted to public representatives who are supposed to ethically look after the interests of the citizenry particularly the most vulnerable in our society Let me hasten to say however that all should not be painted with the same brush of disdain There are exceptions to this trend both in the public and private sector What is sad though is that these examples of excellence observations are probably what prompted President Jacob Zuma to say in a recent speech commenting on the general state of morality in the country South Africa is a land of thugs a statement for which he has received much criticism from many of his detractors But it appears there is widespread agreement regarding the presence of endemic corruption in our system of governance The acknowledgement of this reality naturally prompts a number of questions like why are there no systems and measures implemented for the eradication of this scourge Why does the majority of the electorate continue to vote the same people into power who continue to mismanage and perpetuate the corruption when it is clear that they neither approve nor condone these practices Perhaps most critical to our discussion is the question as bad as apartheid was was it really as bad as the breakdown in the integrity of governance and the subsequent and continuing erosion of service delivery as we currently witness This is the emerging narrative I believe requires scrutiny or another from South Africans of all colours but notably black erudite citizens with solid struggle credentials Perhaps the apartheid system of governance was not as bad as all that they say This sentiment was recently echoed by Dr Mamphele Ramphele respected social activist and businesswoman and Prof Jonathan Jansen vice chancellor of the University of the Free State when they both lamented the state of education in the country They intimated that as bad as education in apartheid South Africa was it was not nearly as bad as the public education offered in present day South Africa A few years ago to even think that way would have been considered sacrilegious but this narrative is becoming bolder with each passing government indiscretion It is not the criticism of the current government that is of interest to me but rather that it seems to draw a comparison with a system that was declared a crime against humanity The fact that those who suffered under the diabolical system of apartheid are even vocalising their that no one other than those who harbour racist reactionary sentiments is advocating for a return to apartheid This is unthinkable It is the acknowledgement I contend of the efficiency in the delivery of services and the implementation of policy during apartheid that is longed for It is precisely the fact that such an evil system was so well executed that further emphasises the pathology of the current one It is the idea that a legitimate and democratic system of governance can fail so dismally to deliver basic services largely because of ineptitude and corruption in the face of such overwhelming support that boggles the mind This narrative also brings into clear view and unravels a mystery that has confounded the minds of many a commentator Namely why do the black masses continue to vote for a party that so obviously does not care for them Many have suggested this is because of a lack of education and the sentimentalisation of historical political alignments amongst the masses It has been said that the black masses service delivery and racial identification These are the kind of explanations that have perpetuated the idea that blacks are irrational hordes of savages bent on destruction and mayhem Indeed the peculiar nostalgia seems to give credence to these assertions Clearly there must be something inherently wrong with blacks when they admit that perhaps the former regime was better at service delivery than their black government but continue to vote for them Well here is an alternative suggestion Yes hospitals functioned well the borders were not as porous the cities were not overrun with blacks and foreigners unions knew their place education was bad but not this bad and the garbage was fetched on time This was the reality and privilege of a very few mostly white citizens while the masses suffered under crippling poverty constant violence and dehumanisation Indeed there are many more efficiencies we could point to that were lost in the new dispensation Many of which had no inclination whatsoever towards the notion of human rights for or against this narrative that is neither here nor there The fact is that the nostalgic narrative is an indictment on the current government and not a desire for apartheid it is a deep lamentation a desperate wakeup call Apartheid was a corrupt system which was brutally but efficiently run That is why it was sustained for as long as it was So terrible so traumatic was the black experience under apartheid that black people would rather be subjected to the corruption ineptitude and abuse of the current government than even contemplate a return to the apartheid system The current system is a legitimate and democratic system badly run by corrupt individuals and because of this corruption the legitimacy is fast fading It is this fundamental difference that the masses understand the difference between a corrupt system and corruption in a system This system the postapartheid system of governance is one they were instrumental in bringing about through struggle against the oppression of apartheid It is

and Nigeria among world s fastest growing economies in 20122013 The west African nations of Ghana and Nigeria are expected to be among the world s fastest growing economies in 2012 according to an emailed research note by Charles Robertson global chief economist at Renaissance Capital In 2011 Ghana was the fastest growing economy from a total of 43 markets included in Renaissance s graphs This growth was largely off the back of Ghana s new oil industry Nigeria had the 6th highest GDP growth ahead of India In 2012 Ghana is again expected to show the strongest GDP growth with Nigeria in 4th position However next year Ghana s growth will slow down while Nigeria is likely to remain in 4th position Finally Ghana shifts out of overdrive and gives Asia a chance to shine a little though personally I doubt China will be growing at 9 in 2013 Around 7 to 8 looks more realistic if only due to base effects the continent s largest economy is likely to grow faster than Australia It might be a good time for the South Africans who emigrated to Australia to sell up their inflated property prices sell the overvalued AUD and move back to South Africa says Robertson A lot of the emerging Europe Middle East and Africa economies we cover are doing an awful lot better than most give them credit for Helped by Nigeria Kazakhstan and Ghana they take two to three places in the top 5 in 201113 South Africa consistently beats developed market commodity exporters says Robertson Your Vogue history Model Safety 17 April 2012 Lauren Milligan Carole White founder of Premier Model Management AFTER Premier founder and legendary model agent Carole White met MP Jo Swinson to discuss the treatment of models under the age of 18 on BBC Radio 4 s Women s Hour they decided to continue the discussion afterwards with Swinson paying a visit to Premier s offices A productive visit we can both talk laughed White they discussed model chaperoning the regulation of unscrupulous agents how models are scouted how agencies support models how the casting and booking process works and whether agencies should bear any responsibility for the shape of catwalk models and the effect of the media s promotion of thin as ideal on women generally Modelling agencies clearly take the view that they are catering for the market as it is without passing judgement on whether our visual culture is healthy or to be welcomed Swinson said is that fashion designers magazines and modelling agencies all claim they ca nt change the way things work as the other parts of the system require them to design for book or scout a particular type of girl I understand her point of view White said Paris and NY want girls to be really too skinny and the designers should make their sample sizes more realistic but I feel it will never change that much because the designers are selling a dream which is taken down and changed by the high street On the catwalk girls will always be tall and skinny It is not as extreme as she believes but it s always easy to pick on a young pretty tall skinny girl is nt it So what needs to change Child models should receive the same protection as child actors and be chaperoned to shoots and catwalk shows until they are 16 and arguably beyond Swinson argued Given the to 18 by 2015 the industry should consider what impact this will have on the age of models they should employ Obviously young models are chaperoned to a degree and often when they travel they have a parent with them White explained However if a model is used to London and feels confident that they can get around very often after a while they do nt want or need a chaperone As agents we know all of our clients and are able to discuss with them if a girl needs someone with them or not We always talk to the parents as well To my mind there should be more done about obese teenagers and education in nutrition and exercise which we do with all our models White added We want fit healthy

news by email Invalid emailThanks for subscribing Could not subscribe try again later Getty A police officer is to be charged with racially abusing a suspect during the London riots last summer PC Alex MacFarlane of the Metropolitan Police was allegedly recorded by the suspect on his mobile phone as he was taken into custody The footage appears to show the Scotland Yard officer tell the 21yearold black man The problem with you is you will always be a n yeah That s your problem yeah The case was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission who passed the file to the Crown Prosecution Service It was initially decided not to prosecute Mr MacFarlane but the case was reviewed after the man s lawyers complained The CPS has now concluded that there conviction The announcement came as the police watchdog announced a review of a string of complaints about racism at the Metropolitan Police warning of the risks of much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction with the force There are now 11 separate allegations under investigation involving 10 police officers Alison Saunders chief prosecutor for London said she had advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane despite the CPS s decision not to charge him in January In March the complainant s lawyers challenged that decision and in accordance with standard CPS practice Grace Ononiwu Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London directed that the case be reviewed by a more senior lawyer who was not previously involved That review is now complete and the conclusion based on all the evidence now available is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge PC MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to Section 4a of the Public Order Act 1998 When a review shows a previous decision not to prosecute is wrong it is open to the CPS to rectify that error by bringing new proceedings Ms Saunders said the original CPS decision was regrettable adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence PC MacFarlane was stripped of his duties in relation to the mobile phone footage The arrested man named as Mauro Demetrio 21 from Beckton east London was held on suspicion of drugdriving in August last year but no action was later taken The charging announcement came as Met Commissioner BernardHogan Howe appeared before MPs over the force s review of racist allegations Ms Saunders said As Chief Crown Prosecutor for London I have taken the decision in this case that as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and a prosecution being in the public interest a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system the Code for Crown Prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution Accordingly I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary An additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of strangulation will not be pursued the CPS said Ms Saunders added However having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this There is also he took hold of the complaint did so He and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant s apparent aggression and in selfdefence I agree with the conclusion that in the circumstances there is insufficient evidence to meet the Code test for bringing charges Another allegation of abuse by a police officer against a youth at Forest Gate police station remains under consideration the CPS said Cambodia s long awaited stock exchange begins trading Image caption The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority is responsible for purifying the raw water for people to drink it from the tap The murky brown liquid swirling in a tank behind Phnom Penh s barelyused railway station does not immediately seem like anything to rouse the excitement of international investors After all it is just water drawn from one of the city s main rivers the Tonle Sap But the interest of fund managers and individual punters alike has been piqued by what happens to the raw water after it leaves the intake tank A series of chemical and filtration processes purify the liquid until it is clean enough to drink straight from the tap Several international sanitation experts have told the BBC that Phnom Penh enjoys one of the best domestic supplies in South East Asia Image caption PPWSA says it ll use the money to provide clean water to the rest of the people in Phnom Penh And the company responsible the first stock to be traded on the Cambodia Securities Exchange We feel very happy and proud because we have made history in our country says the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority s director general Ek Sonn Chan The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority PPWSA has shelves full of trophies marking the international awards it has won not just for the quality of its product but its business affairs as well Oversubscribed This explains a large part of its appeal to investors who may have viewed Cambodia as a risky bet PPWSA s reputation not only soothed those nerves but stoked demand for the company s shares The initial public offering IPO of 15 of the hitherto stateowned company was 17times oversubscribed Ek Sonn Chan believes that having outside shareholders on board will increase the company s accountability and contribute to the growth of corporate responsibility in the country as a whole Meanwhile the money raised by the IPO roughly 20m to grow We need more companies to listMorten Kvammen SBI Royal Securites We will increase our coverage by the construction of additional treatment plans and lay more distribution to provide clean water to the rest of the people in Phnom Penh who have nt yet received water And we will probably expand our business to the rest of the country and perhaps other countries too If PPWSA workers want to find out how their company s shares are performing they will not have to travel far The Cambodia Securities Exchange CSX is based in Canadia Tower diagonally opposite the water company s headquarters A gigantic video screen outside proudly announces that the first day s trading will start at 909am followed by a succession of adverts for securities firms offering to help clients trade in Cambodian stocks String of delays But those traders have had little to do since the official launch of the CSX in July 2011 The 25th floor Trading Room is the size of dealmakers but the day before the launch it was deserted as usual From now on however that should change Image caption Cambodian Minister of Economy and Finance at the inauguration ceremony in July 2011 This is the real start of the market says Morten Kvammen the director of SBI Royal Securities one of a small number of licensed brokers in Cambodia There have been ceremonies the opening of the exchange building and the launch of the systems But this the first day of real trading on the exchange There s been a lot of interest both from foreign institutions and a lot of individual investors many of them local but also some of them from overseas he adds Some of this is undoubtedly due to the novelty of the IPO Once trading starts it should soon become clear if there is a sustained appetite for PPWSA stock at or above the offer price of 157 likes of the Wall Street Journal tipping it as a place to invest there seems to be reason for optimism But one stock alone will not be enough to sustain the CSX We need more companies to list says Morten Kvammen Two more stateowned companies Telecom Cambodia and the Port Of Sihanoukville are due to follow PPWSA on to the CSX in the coming months But so far there has been little sign of any privatelyheld enterprises taking the plunge If a local conglomerate like the Royal Group which has interests in everything from a mobile phone network to a bank decided to list it would send a clear indication that Cambodia had embraced the stock market model Recent Articles Hosting and cloud computing service provider SoftLayer is getting into the modern hybrid supercomputer racket with the launch of GPUenhanced server instances SoftLayer which is based in Dallas was founded in 2005 and merged with hosting rival The Planet before being bought up by GI Partners in 2010 GI Partners is a private equity company coheadquartered in Menlo Park and London that has 6bn in assets including data center and telecom operators and real estate SoftLayer is the resulting entity and it has all the goodness of all the different firms wrapped up into a single package The company is privately held but said back in December that it had over 100000 servers under management in its various data centers and that it had over 25000 customers worldwide using its infrastructure cloud which it characterizes as the largest in the world About half of those customers are located outside of the United States and thus the company said last October that it was investing 75m over the next two network points of presence PoPs in London Frankfurt and Amsterdam to reach that demand SoftLayer had 85m in revenues in the quarter and these metrics put it at a portion of the size of crossstate and OpenStackobsessed rival Rackspace Hosting which is based in San Antonio and which had 2646m in revenues 78717 servers and 161422 customers in the third quarter of 2011 Both SoftLayer and Rackspace developed their own infrastructure control software but Rackspace has thrown in with NASA to create the OpenStack project hoping to forge an open source community that can go up against and beat the cloudy infrastructure stack from Amazon s Web Services behemoth SoftLayer s homegrown Infrastructure Management System tool can provision bare metal and virtual servers and can be accessed either through the customer portal or through an API stack programmatically And SoftLayer has no interest in moving to OpenStack or anything else at this time mainly because the IMS tool speaks bare metal as well as virty Perhaps equally important for SoftLayer is hosted or virty servers so customers get the right iron for their specific jobs Whatever you want we ll crack open the box and drop it in Simon West chief marketing officer at SoftLayer tells El Reg SoftLayer has about a dozen different default configurations of server nodes in its data centers and keeps enough parts on hand in its chop shop so it can spin up any nonstandard requests for 20 servers in about two hours It might take six to eight hours to spin up 100 custom nodes SoftLayer gets its servers and parts from Super Micro Inside SoftLayer s Dallas data center click to enlarge The new GPUgoosed service from SoftLayer is available on the hosted servers not cloud infrastructure because for the most part customers who are running supercomputing code do nt want another layer of software abstraction burning up processor cycles memory capacity and IO bandwidth The HPC nodes are based on 3U SuperMicro barebones machines that are equipped with the two of the moment SoftLayer is supporting Intel s Xeon 2520 2650 and 2690 processors in the HPC nodes and you can add one or two of Nvidia s Tesla M2090 GPU coprocessors to the box These are the topend Tesla coprocessors at least until future coprocessors based on the Kepler GPU ship later this year and deliver 665 gigaflops of doubleprecision floating point number crunching each A dedicated server node with a single Xeon E52620 processor with 16GB of memory runs 500 a month and adding a single GPU and a 500GB SATA disk only boosts the price to 879 per month Considering that those GPUs cost several thousand dollars a pop clearly renting them from SoftLayer or any other service provider that can spin up a hybrid ceepiegeepie cloud is a good idea unless you know you can keep the infrastructure busy SoftLayer has two private Ethernet networks that it uses internally within and across its data centers which run at Gigabit or 10 Gigabit speeds Customers wanting to deploy HPC instances costs more to do so on the portions of the SoftLayer data centers that have 10GE switches reaching out to the server nodes Like Amazon s Cluster Compute Instances InfiniBand is not supported on the SoftLayer backbone but if enough customers asked for it then it would be easy enough to carve out a chunk of capacity to support InfiniBand A base operating system license which includes a Standard Edition of Windows Server 2008 or CentOS Red Hat Enterprise or Debian Linux is included in the price SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is not supported at the time but you can if you really want to run the XenServer hypervisor from Citrix Systems on the HPC instances if you really want to You can of course also load your own software stack onto the images says West provided you have paid for them You have to install the job scheduling and cluster management software of your choice on the nodes SoftLayer operates 13 data centers around the world six Houston Washington DC Singapore and Amsterdam The

young audiences Only 30 percent of people 18 to 34 read a newspaper in print or digitally on an average day according to the Newspaper Association of America That s down from 35 percent in 2009 But there s no reason to give up hope on reaching the digital and even print audiences of the future Based on research and the advice of news outlets that do reach young people here are some of the important steps you can take Create a separate product You can take some steps to make your traditional news product more youthfriendly more on that below but to best serve a younger audience you ll want to carve out a separate staff and product The Chicago Tribune chose to solve the problem this way by launching RedEye about 10 years ago as a free weekday publication targeting local 18 to 35yearold readers RedEye adapts some news also has four general assignment reporters doing youthoriented enterprise stories the mainstream press does nt cover They take on beats like the local gay community entrylevel job markets workplace cultural issues local nightlife and dating At some point you have to have a voice and you have to stick to it Ha said And there s going to be a certain type of audience that is drawn to that voice that wo nt be drawn to a different voice You really ca nt mix them without alienating the other or changing who you are as a publication Hire young people Do nt send a 50yearold to do a 25yearold s job My newsroom at RedEye pretty much reflects the audience in terms of age and demographics and interests Ha said So we talk a lot about What are your friends talking about What are they interested in What are nt they interested in We try to use people on staff as a same approach that helps BuzzFeed draw strong traffic from young people especially those in college Managing Editor Scott Lamb told me I m 36 and I m definitely the oldest person on the editorial team by a lot Lamb said We did that as a hiring strategy largely because we want people who are very native to things like Twitter and Facebook At the time Lamb and I were talking last week the twoBuzzFeed posts getting the most traffic were written by an intern Dave Stopera since hired fulltime as an associate editor who still has a year left to complete at New York University It does happen kind of naturally because we re hiring people who think about online content differently than I do Lamb said They ve grown up with it and I think they make things for people like themselves Focus on relevance Journalists may need to expand the boundaries of what they traditionally consider make sense it has to be relevant said Danah Boyd a Microsoft researcher and expert in youth media and privacy issues who also inspired this post with her recent criticism of how mainstream news organizations fail to serve young people If you ve never experienced any of the world outside of your friends and school global news feels alien Boyd told me Young people are deeply engaged in the news of their peers but we do nt call that news At RedEye they define news not just by what seems important but by what seems relevant to their audience Sometimes those two are the same but when they diverge RedEye gives bigger play to the story its audience will find most relevant to their personal lives and experiences Include more context Journalists need to find ways to make complex ongoing storylines accessible to people who perhaps have nt been following every word since Day 1 That s especially important to young people less regular intervals than do their elders and than did previous generations of young people according to Christopher Sopher who researched and blogged extensively on youth and the media and now works for the Knight Foundation Ondemand news consumption he continues also means that online news institutions and even television would benefit from redesigning their content for a grazing audience built to help readers and viewers dropping in at random times who may not have read yesterday s story on a continuing topic In short do nt let a news story get lost in minutiae Remember to pull back widen your focus and explain where this story came from where it s heading and why it matters Some cases might warrant a whole other kind of story an explainer that as Jay Rosen put it does nt provide the latest news or update you on a story but addresses a gap in your understanding the lack of essential background knowledge of America and the Media Management Center at Northwestern University conducted a study in 2009 with 90minute focus groups of teenagers across the country One of the key findings What these teens said they want are news sites that do news well not dumb it down or pose as experts in teen culture In other words you serve young readers by making news clearer fuller more relevant and easier to digest not by sprinkling your copy with hip catchphrases By the way no one says hip anymore Be conversational Most young people do nt look back fondly on their time sitting in giant lecture halls listening to a teacher dryly exposit facts So they re equally unexcited by many mainstream news outlets that communicate the same way The traditional style of newspaper writing is too impersonal and formulaic for younger readers It s not especially good writing for adult readers either but they re used to it What does conversational s one regular person sitting across a cafe table from you asking what you ve heard today Use bitesized facts That NAA study referenced earlier found that almost universally teens reject pages with uninterrupted text in favor of those that offer information in smaller bitesized chunks with multiple entry points Bullet points and subheadlines are your friend Give each point its own distinct visual and narrative space This is how RedEye applies the model even to solemn news like the Trayvon Martin killing Trayvon Martin The big picture The shooting death of Trayvon Martin has grabbed national headlines and renewed the conversation about race relations gun laws and even how young men dress Here are other notable events since the incident occurred last month gtgtGeraldo Rivera caused a stir when he claimed Martin s hoodie was as responsible gtgtESPN has made an exception to its Twitter policy for the Martin case permitting employees to wear hoodies in their online avatars gtgtPlayers on the Miami Heat and one of the most popular teams in the league took pictures of themselves last week wearing hoodies gtgtDemocrats on the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are scheduled to hold an unofficial hearing Tuesday gtgtThe case has rippled across the nation and prompted rallies protesting the failure of the police to arrest the shooter gtgtDeclaring that If I had a son he d look like Trayvon President Obama on Friday joined the heated national debate There are other less common story forms you also can use to break down information and make it easier to understand Games quizzes even an educational coloring book for young children There s a thin line of course between this directive and the advice not to dumb it down Breaking information into digestible pieces does nt mean you have to deliver less information Ease off on those paywalls Young readers may be one of the first casualties of a website s paywall Many of them lack disposable see the appeal of spending it on your news product unless you ve overcome all the previously mentioned issues Young people are nt going out of their way to try to find this news so you put up one little wall and poof done Boyd said in her previous interview When I hear news agencies talk about wanting to get young people they do nt want to figure out how to actually inform them they want to hear how to monetize them And that pisses me off Some of our readers objected to that comment including Tennessean reporter Brian Haas When I hear young people talk about consuming news they do nt want to pay for it they want it all for free And that pisses me off Boyd clarified this to me I do nt object to monetization I just think that when you lead with monetization you often fail to engage people who are hesitant to engage in the that we recognize that journalism has a public good responsibility as well as a bottom line responsibility If you can embrace some of these changes while staying true to your mission and not alienating your existing audience you should be on your way to building important relationships with the next generation i like this simple thinkDo nt send a 50yearold to do a

political scientist Alan Ehrenhalt author of The Great Inversion and the Future of the American City they re flocking back in droves these days For example at the time of 911 there were 15000 people living south of the World Trade Center By 2007 there were 50000 The strollers have reached Wall Street Take a walk down there some Saturday and you will see for yourself In other words our manifest destiny is no longer toward wider open spaces and bigger homes it s more like a refrain from the famous Petula Clark song Downtown things ll be great when you re Downtown Inspired by his hero the grassroots activist and urban planner Jane Jacobs Ehrenhalt walked around many of America s big cities over the past 10 years Chicago New Phoenix trying to understand how they were changing What he discovered was a radical rearrangement in which people who possessed money and choice were increasingly living in the center while newcomers and the poor were settling in the suburbs often in the outer reaches of suburban territory In short many American metropolitan areas were coming to look more like the European cities of a century ago This cultural phenomenon unobserved and underreported convinced Ehrenhalt that American society was in fact demographically inverting right under our noses hence the term demographic inversion as opposed to gentrification With a quick glance backwards Ehrenhalt offers up Baron GeorgesEugene Haussmann s redesigned Paris of the 1860s with a few references to fin de si cleVienna as the paradigmatic city with its percolating street life acting as a theatre for living and in Ehrenhalt s mind what the millions of people with substantial earning power or ample savings are with Sheffield a neighborhood three miles north of downtown Chicago as a prime example of this great demographic inversion Ehrenhalt takes his reader on a tour of the changing American cityscape pointing out the salient features that have given rise to the transformation of this once shabby working class neighborhood into one of cosmopolitan chic the proximity to downtown Chicago the mass transit station the nearby university the charming Victorian cottages and the commercial corridor And that s just Sheffield Chicago s entire Loop five miles north and south of downtown and a mile from Lake Michigan exploded by 48 in just seven years between 2000 and 2007 Ehrenhalt cites a few other nearcenter arrondissements that have similarly burgeoned over the past decade namely Portland Ore and Clarendon Va eight miles due west of DC He implies but does not come right out and say that the linchpins for their success are threefold 1 jobs 2 readily accessible lightrail transit and 3 charm From Nowhere a similarly themed endeavor promotes the intersection of relationships and invites one set of patterns to interact with other patterns including the complex patterns of individual human minds From there the great inversion is not so great The Bushwick section of Brooklyn for example Long synonymous with grim poverty gangs and drug dealers it is today a happening bedroom community for New York s young artists Be that as it may there are still long dreary blocks lined with abandoned textile factories and large strips of vacant land Cheap yes lively sure but still uglier than a stump full of spiders Philadelphia is another notexactlythereyet city that Ehrenhalt examines Yes Philly has an elegant central core along Walnut Street with a lunchtime pedestrian count of more than two thousand a day but it also has more violent crimes per capita than any of the other 10 largest cities in America and according to the 365 for every one thousand residential units Not exactly an American Vienna Ehrenhalt shows us the suburban side of the story in Gwinnett County Georgia a suburb outside Atlanta This was once a rural expanse of 437 acres and today the quintessence of our suburban immigrant nation There s even a new Taj Mahal there called Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushoram Swaminarayan Sanstha temple BAPS for short situated next to a Walgreens in Lilburn Ga Gwinnett used to have great football teams but with the influx of Asian immigrants its highest scores are now recorded on the SATs The demographic is split right down the middle 5050 white to nonwhite Then there are to use Ehrenhalt s own analogy the Pinocchios Phoenix is a centralcoreless sprawlscape that is trying its hardest to make itself over into an urban center and though they are investing heavily in miles of transit lines and new centers of urbanity their plan at present is to build has emerged as the capital of the suburban town center phenomenon has converted an unused airport ten minutes from the city s downtown into a new urban experiment in the retrofitting of suburban America with shops and residents all in one So much for Haussmann s 1860s Paris The Great Inversion is an enjoyable and engaging read especially for those considering a move back to the city It is solidly researched with great questions asked and plenty of hard facts and anecdotal answers provided And though Ehrenhalt manages to keep his objectivity throughout most of the book at the very end he reveals himself to be a cockeyed Europtimist to wit people are settling in cities those who have a choice in large part to experience the things that citizens of Paris and Vienna experienced a century ago round the clock street life caf sociability casual acquaintances they meet on the sidewalk every day merchants who recognize them This is the direction I think we are heading in however he might want to make note of the fact that McDonald s and Walmart announced record profits in 2010 and GM did the same in 2011 Vive Les tatsUnis Richard Horan is a novelist and the author of Seeds One Man s Serendipitous Journey to Find the Trees that Inspired Famous American Writers from Faulkner to Kerouac Welty to Wharton His latest work Harvest A Picaresque Adventure into the Heart of America s Family Farms is due out this summer from Harper Collins Suing the Department of Defense for Dereliction of Its Duty This past Friday Protect Our Defenders partnered with Susan Burke to file a lawsuit against West Point and the Naval Academy The suit accuses the academies of failing to prosecute cadets and midshipmen who have raped their fellow students Burke filed the lawsuit four days after Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced what were touted as major reforms in the way the military handles sexual assault and rape In reality these socalled reforms fall well short of the fundamental reform required The new policy does very little to address the culture of tolerance for rape that pervades the US military and has given rise to the existing epidemic Plaintiffs Kelly Marquet and Anne Kendzior courageously stepped forth alleging their military academies have a high tolerance for sexual predators in the ranks and zero tolerance for those who rape Marquet a top Pennsylvania student and athlete chose West Point over other top schools because she wanted to serve in the second semester of her freshman year Marquet contacted the West Point Sexual Assault Response Coordinator SARC for help But instead of receiving support she was punished for coming forward Superiors allegedly forced Marquet to take out the trash from her rapist s room daily and assigned her to do walking hours with him Left with no other choice she resigned Kendzior a Texas high school soccer star was recruited by top colleges and universities and chose to attend the Naval Academy Kendzior alleges that different cadets raped her on two occasions After struggling with the effects of the rapes on her own Kendzior confided in her Academy counselor The counselor discouraged her from reporting the rapes and Kendzior continued to suffer in isolation Eventually the Naval Academy used her mental health records to disqualify her from commissioned officer status Only her parents and Congressperson s intervention prevented the Academy from committing her to a mental health facility Kendzior was forced to leave the Academy without graduating comes to protecting academy students from sexual violence and providing services for assault victims The 2011 DOD annual report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies found that West Point did not comply with the DoD s sexual assault prevention policy and that the academies in general have failed to implement or enforce DoD policy According to the DoD there were 65 reports of sexual assault in the academies in 2010 up from 41 in 2009 However according to DoD surveys less than 10 percent of the actual cases are reported Common reasons for not reporting include prevalence of victim blaming fear of retaliation and career destruction and the belief that the perpetrator will never be prosecuted Indeed of all the defendants accused in those 65 cases only one has been courtmartialed Instead of undertaking fundamental reforms the Department of Defense has essentially maintained the status quo while claiming reform On April 16 Secretary of Defense Panetta introduced a series of incremental policies to increase the percentage of cases prosecuted the 2011 SAPRO report revealed only 8 percent of sexual assaults resulted in a court martial conviction Secretary Panetta deserves credit for doing more than his predecessors to call attention to this in his own words silent epidemic However many of the recently announced reforms are already in place with limited effect at best in one or more of the services Furthermore the centralized database which Panetta characterized as a reform was ordered by Congress to be operational by January 2010 The DoD s own reports indicate that these policies have not been effective in addressing the problem And then there s the plan to move the authority for these cases up the chain of command Touted as a significant change Panetta s directive requires local commanders to hand over investigations to higherranking officers This appears to be an attempt to redirect attention away from the embarrassing statistics in the FY2011 Report on Sexual Assault in the Military released two courtmartials fell and convictions plummeted with no indication that the number of sexual assaults have decreased Historically there is no evidence that elevating the level of command is more likely to produce effective action The Convening Authority can still unilaterally decide to not move forward with a court martial The command structure is conflicted and in practice already has full authority and responsibility to deal with these cases We would like to believe that this most recent in a series of pledges of zero tolerance will make a difference However we would only know the Pentagon is serious and effective when the careers of those senior commanders who fail to provide positive leadership and take effective action are ended Currently it s a greater risk to a commanding officer s career to acknowledge that an attack occurred than it is for him to sweep it under the rug Paula Coughlin a former Navy lieutenant and helicopter pilot was sexually assaulted at the 1991 aviators Tailhook Association meeting After her investigation public And in 1994 due to further abuse and retaliation she resigned The Navy and Pentagon s response to the resulting widespread negative publicity was to institute what were purported to be groundbreaking reforms As is tragically clear from current reports almost 20 years later those policies have had little if any effect Commenting on the latest DoD reforms Lt Coughlin recently stated The whole thing is poised to be completely ineffective In 1992 the convening authority in my case was deputy to the Commandant of the Marine Corps top grunt all the way he dismissed the case after a cordial meeting with the criminal s minister Fourteen years after the Tailhook incident as alleged in the lawsuit filed in March 2012 former USMC Lt Elle Helmer and Lt Arianna Klay were raped and sexually assaulted by fellow Marines Each suffered retaliation as a result of reporting Investigations botched and rape kits lost Lt Klay and Helmer s careers ruined Both cases were case two three star Generals signed off One alleged rapist remains a Marine in good standing The other convicted but only of adultery and indecent language It is clear that many of the most egregious examples of command failure are occurring at or above the levels to which Secretary Panetta is elevating the responsibility In a democracy we must hold institutions accountable for their transgressions Just as the courts address patterns of abuse within religious institutions or corporations Protect Our Defenders demands justice for the plaintiffs in this lawsuit We need to leverage the powerful voice of the judiciary to achieve real change in the military s practices The military has a long record of abuse within its ranks and impunity for perpetrators It is apparent that the military bureaucracy is unwilling or unable to implement true reform autonomously In additional to judicial redress it appears only legislative action which takes responsibility for victim care investigation and adjudication out of the normal chain of command will make a real difference our military and our democracy It will assure parents that sending their children to serve our country will no longer mean putting them at great risk of sexual assault from their fellow service members The email arrived in James Charles Cafferty s inbox on July 14 2011 Unlike most unsolicited email on the Internet the message did not pitch mortgages get rich quick scams or penis pills Instead it provided a link to an undertheradar child pornography website and the password needed to access it Cafferty a diplomatic security officer working for the US government at its London embassy waited for three days then clicked on the link This is what he saw Welcome to the hidden side of yur soul where you view the yung and innocent We have been around since 2002 offering the best of private and series Child Pornography CP hardcoresoft core all for FREE All you have to do enter in the password and you ll be viewing free CP for days We move around when we have to congratulations for finding us Yur old password wo nt work so get the new one and you its target well Cafferty did have a hidden side of his soul An online dating profile he created at the site Plenty of Fish said that he was looking for a relationship with someone who can enjoy the simple things of life such as walking in the park enjoying a nice sunset engaging in good conversation or go people watching at a caf But he also craved child pornography Cafferty owned a Drobo backup device that he stuffed with twin Western Digital hard drives in a RAID configuration to guard against data loss On the drives he kept his tens of thousands of child porn files Sometimes he did more than look at them too Cafferty would also fire up image editing software on his computer and splice his image into some scenes Below the website s promotional copy sat a law enforcement note the kind that used to feature on warez sites as a talisman that might keep the cops at bay If you happen to viewing this website it s called free speech it said There is nothing illegal about this website Our servers are located in a country that has no Child Pornography laws Even if you are able to shut us down we pop up again somewhere else Cafferty stared at the screen then typed in the password found in the email He was in Another page popped up listing 35 free videos with names like Full version of known video 3 1012 yo girls and man and an explicit description of the action Beside each video was a download button that provided oneminute previews of each video Fortynine seconds after entering his password Cafferty clicked on video number four a 71minute file that claimed to feature a 910 yo girl and man A third webpage opened to display the video which appeared to buffer but the connection soon slowed and then stopped altogether Eventually Cafferty abandoned the site But a data center his online visit had tripped a silent alarm That click on the download button had logged his IP address the video file he attempted to view and the number of times he tried to watch site videos The law enforcement warning on the site s front page had done nothing to keep the FBI away indeed the FBI ran the site And now they had Cafferty Totally a legitimate website Spearphishing FBI style The email had not arrived in Cafferty s inbox by accident Back in 2006 Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE had opened a major investigation into a string of child porn websites As part of that work ICE learned that the sites used PayPal to receive money and disguised the nature of the purchases by using odd subject identifiers A website called Sick Child Room 2005 for instance used as its PayPal subject identifier the phrase SickCR Package v506 Build 3638 which makes it sound like a software names like Door 1 Door 5 and Medic s Corner Behind the doors waited 150 videos and 20000 child porn images Cafferty s mug shot Pinellas County Florida ICE went to Paypal and obtained a list of 5000 people who had subscribed to these sites The priority was of course getting at those who ran the sites but the subscribers were nt off the hook One of the email addresses that had purchased access to the Sick Child Room was Travelerva88yahoocom Investigators served an administrative subpoena to Yahoo which turned over subscriber information for the account It belonged to someone who also used the address caffertyjgmailcom and who worked in London but who listed a Largo Florida home address The information from Yahoo also contained surprisingly enough a link to the user s Facebook profile Putting Cafferty s name to the account was nt particularly difficult after this Investigators eventually realized that their target was a US government employee working as a Bureau this point it was July 2011 and the child porn purchases had happened 5 years before Investigators decided that before pursuing Cafferty they wanted to know if he was still involved in the CP scene The case went to Corey Monaghan a detective in the Largo Florida police department and a member of the FBI s nationwide Innocent Images Task Force On July 14 2011 Monaghan contacted his colleagues at the FBI s Innocent Images Operations Unit in Maryland and asked them to deploy an investigative tool to determine Cafferty s continued interest in child porn In initial court documents all descriptions of the tool were redacted but the Smoking Gun got its hands on the unredacted original and published several key pages The FBI had set up its fake CP site for precisely this situation When investigators had a lead on someone specific they emailed the person with a custom password and the site URL The strangely explicit front page discussion about the Child Pornography within made were accessing As Monaghan s unredacted affidavit makes clear nowhere on the website home page indicates sic any adult pornography or anything other than child pornography is available through this website In reality the site offered no child porn the video loading screen had been purposebuilt to fail in such a way that visitors believed their Internet connections to be the culprits Soon after Cafferty s visit to the site the Innocent Images task force knew they had found their man Not only had he used his custom password he had logged in with a London IP address Time to pay him a visit A picture from March 25 2012

That s because hard work does nt always pay the bills The inability to overcome a language barrier or find transportation or a lack of knowledge of the modern world can make it difficult to find work City of Refuge a notforprofit organization that assists refugees from around the world helps hundreds of families make it in the United States The population of refugees in Central Missouri specifically Columbia continues to increase as residents of troubled nations and territories seek asylum in the United States Although it remains unknown exactly how many refugees are residing in Central Missouri Refugee and Immigration Services of the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City is believed to be responsible for the majority of local immigration Wheeler said Since 1975 the agency has assisted people from Asia Africa Eastern Europe and Latin America find their way to Central Missouri The diocese pays rent for refugee families for the first six months month of paid utilities also are provided It s not until grant funding is depleted that the newcomers are in some ways on their own in a great big new world Through City of Refuge Wheeler said she tries her best to provide people with the resources they need That means transportation to doctors appointments English classes clothing food and most important work Started in September 2010 City of Refuge was organized in response to the generosity of others and success of a small cleaning service Wheeler created called SafiSana LLC The organization s origins however date back to January 2009 when Wheeler and her husband Adam Wheeler a local pediatrician were attending a Christian Fellowship Church service About 50 East African immigrants often attended services but Wheeler said she feared to approach them I used to be afraid to speak to people who did nt speak English she said I knew they were there What would to make the refugees feel at home so a group of refugees ages 15 to 25 attended dinner one night for Bible study Lucky to have a trio of French interpreters Wheeler said she made a connection with her new friends and recognized their needs They have never seen spaghetti or tacos she said Everything we made we had to show them how to eat it I got that burden that night Wheeler said she became fascinated with the stories some would tell and the way they lived their lives Raised in Florissant she recalls her middleclass lifestyle and the very white neighborhood she grew up in to be foreign from the obstacles these newcomers face People come to the United States for many reasons Some Iraqi refugees have been relocated to Columbia because they assisted the American government and its troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom Others come from villages or refugee camps in Africa and Malaysia where people slept on the dirt and their lone things American adults do each day to get by Wheeler said are new and unfamiliar to these people She found herself assisting many with the simple tasks of reading their mail teaching them to operate cellphones and helping set up bank accounts Refugees and their children also had transportation needs At the time I had two kids I said I m not their mom Adam said Yes you are Wheeler explained I thought about it and embraced it Recognizing a need for employment Wheeler said she dreamed up the idea of starting a cleaning service SafiSana which means very clean in Swahili was born soon after I literally Googled How to start a business she said On average about 10 to 15 people work for the cleaning service which has contracts with local hotels and businesses for work that pays about 9 an hour Turnover is high because some like the work because they have no experience in making beds and find little fulfillment Profit derived from the business is used for employees basic needs Wheeler said When she realized the multitude of services she provided it only made sense to create a notforprofit such as City of Refuge and establish SafiSana as a division of the charity In January an additional division of the charity sprung to life with the creation of Freedom Landscapes Operated by James Rawlings the lawn service employs four refugees The organization s slogan is Freeing you from yard work while offering freedom to refugees I m not in it to make a killing Rawlings said I do well enough to make a living and provide a living for refugees A youth pastor at Midway Baptist Church Rawlings said his church also provides services to local refugees With the assistance of Lori Stoll a volunteer who now coordinates SafiSana Wheeler also has delegated transportation and father of four escaped civil war in Congo to reside in camps in Burundi before his immigration to America An educated man Rusaya supervised a notforprofit HIV clinic while in Africa and at one time attempted to open a school in a Burundi camp He said his family fled after continuous uprisings and witnessing assassinations In Columbia Rusaya bounced from job to job He worked at a local hotel for seven months but quit before taking over for Wheeler He now takes other refugees to doctor dentist and other appointments sometimes as far as Kansas City and St Louis They tell me to do stuff but I do nt understand he said of his first jobs Rusaya finds more dignity in driving than cleaning work His education does not meet the credentials of American standards but he hopes to return to school in the fall Through material donations to City of Refuge such as food clothes books DVDs and electronics Wheeler said Those funds go toward special projects such as potentially helping Rusaya with tuition or reuniting refugee families Thang Khen Pau and Vung Lun Cing a Burmese couple are refugees who both worked for Wheeler s SafiSana and are hopeful to bring Cing s brother from Burma Pau said he was so thankful for the opportunity to work and provide for his wife and two children upon arrival to Columbia that it was hard to move on because he was loyal He did so when a higherpaying job came along and Cing now works as a stayathome mom I can feed three families here he said of sending money back to both his and Cing s parents Here in Columbia Pau said life is much better than in Burma There Pau worked construction with his uncle Without payment the army would make them build structures If I do nt leave they would come get us he said of the army The couple recognizes Some come from the forest and lack basic skills such as reading and writing Cing said In contrast Pau and Cing said they learn English each day from their oldest daughter 4yearold

Air Force Base dormitory being used for children who crossed the border alone In April 2012 federal officials began housing 200 illegal immigrant children at the base turning a vacant dormitory that was once the living quarters of basic training recruits into an emergency shelter for young illegal immigrants Office of Public Affairs Administration for Children and Families via The New York Times EDITORIAL USE ONLY An undated handout photo of a Lackland Air Force Base dormitory being used for children who crossed the border alone In April 2012 federal officials began housing 200 illegal immigrant children at the base The unprecedented surge of children caught trudging through South Texas scrublands or crossing at border ports of entry to expand their shelter legal representation and reunification services On any given day this year the US Office of Refugee Resettlement has been caring for more than 2100 unaccompanied child immigrants The influx came to light last week when 100 kids were taken to Lackland AFB for temporary housing It was the first time the government has turned to the Defense Department now 200 boys and girls younger than 18 stay in a base dormitory While the issue of unaccompanied minors arriving in the US is nt new the scale of the recent increase is From October 2011 through March 5252 kids landed in US custody without a parent or guardian a 93 percent increase from the same period the previous year according to data released by the Department of Health and Human Services In March alone 1390 kids arrived The cause of the surge remains a mystery to child migrant advocates and government officials The kids are coming from the same places as usual Guatemala El Salvador of explanations they made the trek to look for parents already in the US they re seeking economic opportunity to send money home they want to escape violence or abuse We re talking to the children but we do nt have one solid answer said Lauren Fisher of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project which helps children and their families navigate the system There seem to be the same reasons that we ve seen before Some have suggested that human smugglers are more aggressively marketing their services Others wonder if the Border Patrol whose presence has doubled in recent years is simply catching more of them But Border Patrol apprehensions of children and adults were cut in half from 2008 to 2011 and only 5 percent of those caught are unaccompanied children Younger children commonly cross with adult smugglers at the ports of entry while older kids join groups that follow guides through the brush A South Texas woman told border authorities this month that Hidalgo Texas and Reynosa Mexico was her sister according to court records She even presented a Texas birth certificate But the girl could nt answer basic questions so the woman told customs officers that she was nt related to the girl at all She said that a man whom she worked with in Mexico offered her 2000 to cross the girl who was actually from Guatemala and accompany her to Houston The woman was charged with transporting an illegal immigrant Last week the first ladies of Mexico Honduras and Guatemala spoke at a threeday conference on unaccompanied minors in Washington DC Mexico s first lady Margarita Zavala and Honduras Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo noted that tougher US border security made it more difficult for parents working in the US to return for their children a suggestion as to why parents increasingly would put their children in a smuggler s care The statistics are worrisome said Rosa Maria Leal de Perez Guatemala children repatriated in the last year Child welfare groups are in triage mode said Wendy Young executive director of Kids in Need of Defense a Washington DCbased nonprofit that matches pro bono attorneys with unaccompanied minors navigating the immigration system It s important that the resources and the capacity meet the need and we re not quite there yet The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in 10 states range from shelters to foster homes and have about 2500 beds Governmentcontracted shelters were maxing out their emergency bed space setting up cots in gymnasiums and other extra spaces It s a much more limited set of services Fisher said It felt something like a Red Cross shelter a hurricane shelter Unaccompanied children are first processed by the Department of Homeland Security then turned over to the ORR while the deportation process begins Once in a shelter the search begins for relatives or an acceptable with pro bono attorneys When a custodian is found the child can leave the shelter and await immigration proceedings Eighty percent of the children referred to the ORR end up in a shelter according to a report released last month by the Vera Institute of Justice a nonprofit that developed a program to better provide access to legal services for children The average shelter stay is 61 days At the Lackland shelter HHS spokesman Jesse Garcia said the goal is to move kids to more establishe accommodations within 15 days We are looking to add some educational features that are appropriate for a 30day temporary program Garcia said As of late Friday 83 children had already been transferred out of Lackland most to permanent facilities Nineteen had been reunited with family A new report says that more and more selfemployed people are having difficulties in accessing credit and paying their mortgage and loan payments SELFEMPLOYED PEOPLE are having growing problems with debt accessing credit and paying off loans and mortgages a new report shows Hard Times for the SelfEmployed The Citizens Information and MABS Experience was published by the Citizens Information Board today and launched by the Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton TD It shows that Citizens Information Services are seeing more people using their services while MABS is reporting growing problems of indebtedness among the selfemployed Some of the key areas of concern include Absence of insurance cover for shortterm unemployment and illness Changing scenario for employment and selfemployment The report points out that insurance cover may need to be extended to cover shortterm contingencies like illness Difficulty of assessing means Selfemployed people are not entitled to Jobseeker s Benefit or redundancy payments However they can apply for a meanstested Jobseeker s Allowance people can be complex so the report suggests that an additional mechanism for establishing means for JA is required Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton TD said she recognises that selfemployed people make a great contribution to the economy and also recognises that the current economic situation has been difficult for selfemployed people However any measure to provide shortterm benefits to those who are selfemployed would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context An actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund is currently underway and is expected to be completed by July 2012 Gerry Dowling MABS Coordinator DundrumRathfarnham noted that 16 per cent of new clients to his service in 2011 were selfemployed compared to 10 per cent in 2010 and 4 per cent in previous years He said a significant debt issue is inability to keep up mortgage payments Not all selfemployed people are captains of industry Many are cleaners gardeners taxi drivers and tradespeople who are applying skill and abilities now find their income potential eroded However they are in a Catch 22 situation where they need to continue to trade to provide cash for basic personal and family needs but in reality are trading more deeply into debt Dowling acknowledged the contribution of the newly formed CAVA Chartered Accountants Voluntary Assistance scheme which provides advice in businessrelated cases and has proved to be an invaluable referral service for both CISs and MABS Selfemployedsupportsie is a microsite aimed at selfemployed people who have seen a drop off in business

Irish immigrant charged with writing 40000 in bad checks has been sentenced to three years in prison by a Montana Court Kevin Barry McAuley 46 an undocumented Irish immigrant from Belfast was branded a menace to society by a judge who sentenced him to 10 years in prison with seven suspended Due to the fact that McAuley is a federal detainee he will go directly to Montana State Prison where he must serve at minimum one fourth of his sentence after which he will likely be deported back to Ireland The Irishman told people he was an exUS Army Ranger millionaire who had lost his wife in a Christmas Day car crash It is said that with such lies he managed to scam food drink housing a boat and gas from the locals Montana s Helenaircom reports According to court documents McAuley used up to five

said McAuley was nothing but a con artist and that if he was released he would just con more people I gave him all my savings Mohn testified The guy is just a professional con artist He s the scum of the Earth as far as I am concerned If you do nt send him to prison send him to my house I ll fix him The Belfast man had previously been deported from the US but managed to return to the country arriving in Florida by boat The Irishman had several previous convictions relating to an incident in Wisconsin where he helped run an Irish bar near Milwaukee Ireland s Deputy Leader Eamon Gilmore has called on Cardinal Sean Brady to resign after sensational new revelations about his role in covering up the actions of notorious pedophile Father Brendan Smyth The allegations were made in a BBC documentary this week that Brady had covered up his own role in investigating Smyth a notorious pedophile and his victims Brady had claimed he was merely a note taker back in 1987 during an internal church inquiry but the BBC report claimed he was an active participant It is my own personal view that anybody who did not deal with the scale of the abuse that we have seen in this case should not hold a position of authority Gilmore told the Irish parliament Gilmore who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs called it another horrific episode of failure by senior members of the Catholic Church to protect children As far as your question about the Government s position in relation to Cardinal Brady is concerned let me of church and state Gilmore said when asked about it by an opposition member in the parliament I think it is the job of government and of the State to enact out laws and to ensure that those laws apply to everybody whether they belong to a church or not But it is my own personal view that anybody who did not deal with the scale of the abuse that we have seen in this case should not hold a position of authority Meanwhile it has been revealed that the pedophile priest Fr Brendan Smyth abused 30 or more children in the years after Ireland s church leader Cardinal Sean Brady failed to report his crimes according to a top police officer A former RUC detective who worked on the Smyth case has told the Irish Independent that over 30 children were abused after a Church investigation in 1975 was told of his crimes Cardinal Brady is now under intense pressure to quit as more details emerge of his part in the coverup after other children abused by Smyth The report states that Cardinal Brady who is refusing to quit has admitted that there was nothing to stop him going to civil authorities about accusations against the serial paedophile Brady was one of three clerics who investigated the abuse claims against Smyth although he says he was only a notetaker at the meetings A BBC documentary on the case broadcast in Ireland on Tuesday and across Britain on Wednesday has led to calls on Cardinal Brady to resign A police detective involved in subsequent investigations into Smyth s evil reign of terror told the Irish Independent that Brady could have taken action when the allegations first surfaced in 1975 It is my view that there were up to 30 victims of Brendan Smyth between 1975 and his arrest in 1991 and to be honest there could be dozens more that we never ever found out about said the detective Predatory paedophiles like Smyth just do nt suddenly stop I have no have been saved from the most horrific attacks had Smyth been stopped earlier The failure of the Catholic Church to deal with this in 1975 is really unforgivable Asked by the paper what he thought the then Father Brady should have done he said There was a culture of keeping this in the church back then But had he called in the police Smyth could have been stopped He should have told the parents That s my view but it s not for me to say whether he should resign or not Cardinal Brady remains adamant however that he wo nt resign He said he had considered his position in the past but had decided to stay on In a statement the cardinal said The commentary in the programme and much of the coverage of my role in this inquiry gives the impression that I was the only person who knew of the allegations against Brendan Smyth at that time and that because of the office I hold in the church in 1975 Finn signs extension Rovers midfielder Ronan Finn has signed a new deal which will see him contracted to the club until the end of the 2014 season The 24yearold was contracted until the end of this season having signed for the Hoops ahead of the 2011 campaign But today Thursday put pen to paper on a further two year deal Finn has made 62 competitive starts for the Hoops in his 14month period with the club so far and is an integral part of manager Stephen Kenny s plans for the future Speaking about resigning Ronan said I m delighted to have resigned When Stephen said it to me the other day I was chuffed so now to have it all done and dusted is great I m now just looking forward to enjoying the rest of the season at the club knowing that the next couple of years are tied down Security is a big issue in football especially in this league used to be So to sign a two year extension on top of this year is great Playing for Shamrock Rovers is an honour so to know I ll be doing it for another two years is great When you come here you realise how big the club is and once you ve played here you do nt want to leave Commenting on the resigning Kenny said I am delighted that Ronan has extended his contract here He is an integral part of the future of Shamrock Rovers and I ve been very impressed by him since I joined the club Actually one of the things that has impressed me most since I become manager of Shamrock Rovers is Ronan Finn and the talent he possesses It is unique to have a central midfield player who can dribble at pace off either foot There have nt been many players like that in a central midfield position in the league It s very exciting and as he gets stronger full potential has yet to be realised he can go on to be the most influential player in the league with the talent that he has Ronan s application is first class and he has huge desire to improve It is great news for our club that he is going to remain here Hot Topics 158 Shares Email this story to a friend You may think what you see at 20 seconds into the video

Bad Foreigners Doing EVIL It was a touching scene A young American male sat outside of a McDonalds in Nanjing sharing a meal with a homeless lady He had purchased two orders of French fries and poured water into her water bottle A passerby snapped photos and uploaded them onto a Chinese social working site Online people praised the young man whose name is Jason Loose and gave him the nickname Brother Fries This was nt the only recent act of laowai foreign kindness earlier this month a Brazilian man got beat up as he attempted to stop a robbery And just as the Chinese internet dubbed both heroes a 25 yearold British man was caught allegedly molesting multiple women and raping one An altercation broke out and the 25year was beaten senseless Online forums erupted with some stating how awful foreigners were In much of Asia many people s interaction with foreigners is somewhat limited met foreigners in bars But simple maths says that the vast majority of the population will not have any sort of meaningful interaction such as being neighbours work colleagues or even friends This is nt due to racism in countries like say China South Korea or Japan Like I said it s simple math the number of foreigners is comparatively smaller so not everyone has the opportunity to pursue a deeper interaction Thus much of people s perception of foreigners is based entirely on things they read online or popular culture they absorb This is nt unique to Asia This is however also why foreigners in Japan at least are often peppered with possibly irksome questions and comments People have a perception which informs the things they ask and the things they think After I grabbed his neck and saw he s a laowai I felt more obligated to save the girl The recent footage of 25 yearold British man everything awful imaginable Besides the footage of the inebriated man appearing to rape a woman near Beijing s Xuanwumen Station footage that has been analyzed as if it were BlowUp social networking sites photos of that same individual It s difficult to make out what s going on in the pictures but the uploader claimed a bald foreigner was thrusting his erection towards women The photos were the British man earlier that evening before the incident that was captured on video In the video viewable here viewer discrention recommended the woman said she does not know the man Her underwear was exposed The man who first appeared in the video was a 24 yearold security guard from a nearby building After I grabbed his neck and saw he s a laowai I felt more obligated to save the girl he told the Global Times Does that mean he d be less obligated if the accused rapist was Chinese Pictures showing a foreigner helping a Chinese might The beatdown the British man was filmed and uploaded online with the title Laowai We re Going To Kick Your arse Out of China The man who speaks no Chinese and who is on a tourist visa is currently in police custody Chinese legal experts think he ll serve about two weeks in detention and then be deported The whole incident clashed with the foreignerssurearenice attitude that the media played up and it ll serve to reinforce any unsavory stereotypes people in China have Many people no doubt are able to make the distinction between the individual and the group but not everyone What s more making divisions such as foreign or native can not be helped This is a foreign man in China That is no mistake However these same distinctions cause people to lose sight of the individual Instead of thinking that a foreign sharing his food with a homeless lady means all foreigners are nice it s more accurate to note The same holds true for the British man What s lost in this is the big sweeping brushstrokes that the word foreigner leaves out Even if it s being used in a neutral context it separates us and them This is underscored in Loose s reaction to his generosity I shall never gain such wide attention in the US by doing so Loose wrote online about his French fry sharing One reason could be I am not a laowai foreigner at home Another is this kind of thing is quite common in America But this goes even further Li Yonggang a professor who teaches Internet phenomenon at Nanjing University told the Global Times Pictures showing a foreigner helping a Chinese might help raise public awareness about doing good deeds By that logic video of a foreigner doing awful things might help public awareness about doing evil deeds But the sticking point is whether these individuals are behaving is good or bad or because they are in another country and behaving in a manner that they never would at home whether that s doing good deals or truly deplorable ones Culture Smash is a daily dose of things topical interesting and sometimes even

to anyone Six lessons from Australia s richest selfmanaged super funds Monday 14 May 2012 1400 Michael Laurence Share The latest federal budget has focused attention on Australia s bestpaid super fund members an estimated 128000 individuals who earn more than 300000 a year from their employment businesses and nonsuper investments Under a controversial budget measure which could cost as much to administer as the extra tax it will collect the salarysacrificed compulsory and personally deductible contributions of these highearning members will be taxed at 30 from July This is twice the contributions tax being applied to other fund members The government s strike against wealthy super fund members raises fascinating questions for all astute fund members no matter their income and super balances Just who are these highearning fund members How do they invest their super money Can I learn anything from them It is a safe assumption that most of these members earning 300000plus would have their own selfmanaged super fund SMSF And are high because most wealthy people would ensure that they along with their families take as much advantage as possible of concessionallytaxed super A few of Australia s biggest SMSFs have more than 40 million each in assets an asset value that will never again be replicated by selfmanaged funds given the annual caps on super contributions And there are many SMSFs with balances of 6 million to 20 million As highlighted in a recent ATO publication Selfmanaged superannuation funds a statistical overview 200910 rich SMSFs have plenty to teach trustees of SMSFs with vastly smaller assets In short SMSFs with huge balances have on average much higher performance once costs and taxes are taken into account However this outperformance does nt appear to be associated with doing anything extraordinary with investments the asset allocation of rich fund portfolios is surprisingly similar to an averagesized fund The outperformance would largely be attributable to their low costs relative to asset size and their assumed willingness to take quality professional advice about 6000 funds have assets of 5 million to 10 million while just 02 of SMSFs less than 1000 funds have more than 10 million in assets By contrast SMSFs have average assets of 870000 Here are six strategies pursued by the trustees of Australia s richest six that are worth considering 1 Cut costs The ability to shave costs is the great advantage of highasset SMSFs Funds with upwards of 10 million had average costs in 200910 of only 025 of assets This compares with costs of 067 for SMSFs with 500000 to 1 million and a breathtakingly high 7 for SMSFs with up to 50000 in assets The message for all SMSFs is that costs really matter And if your fund s costs seem comparatively high to an averagesized fund find out why Keep a close watch on funds management and fund administration fees And ensure that your fund is not unnecessarily triggering capital gains tax and transaction costs through excessive trading The reality is that Rich SMSFs are able to spread their fixed costs over much more valuable portfolios 2 Question performance SMSFs with 10 millionplus returned an average 89 in 200910 against a return of 687 by SMSFs with 500000 to 1 million and a negative average return of 864 by funds with 50000 or less If your SMSF is underperforming question whether it should be revamped with professional help or whether your money is better served in a big publicoffer super fund The ability of wealthy SMSFs to minimise their costs really lifts their net returns 3 Boost family contributions The trustees of rich SMSFs would typically ensure that their family members including spouses with no employment income and their children of any age contribute as much as possible into the concessionallytaxed super system Anyone under 65 can contribute to super even minors who are not in the workforce And anyone age 6569 can contribute if doing at least some paid work However fund members under 18 are not entitled to or business income Despite the 25000 concessional contributions cap applying to all fund members from July it is still possible to put large amounts into super Even from 201213 fund members will be able to contribute 25000 a year in concessional contributions plus 150000 in nonconcessional contributions This means that a fourperson fund the maximum membership for an SMSF could receive contributions of up to 700000 in contributions a year with each member contributing up to their individual caps 4 Watch for the dangers of owning only one type of asset SMSF tax and regulatory returns show that rich funds are much less likely than small SMSFs to fall into a potential trap of having most of their assets in a single investment or investment asset class such as shares cash or property For instance 38 of SMSFs with 50000 or less in assets have all of their money in a single asset class compared with 2 of funds with more than 10 million in assets And just 5 of funds with 1 a single asset class The logic of not putting everything into one asset or type of asset is simple a fund with a diversified portfolio diversifies its risks and opportunities 5 Think twice before putting all of your investments in super As last week s federal budget illustrates governments are too willing to turn to super in an attempt to raise extra taxes Wellinformed trustees of SMSFs would understand the case for holding both super and nonsuper investments to reduce the risk of government interference Some investors may be surprised at how much can be earned outside super in a taxeffective way In 201213 an individual investor can earn fully franked dividends of about 100000 from shares held outside super without having to pay any additional tax once franking credits are claimed This assumes the taxpayer has no other taxable income A 2 million share portfolio paying a 5 dividend yield is necessary to produce a 100000 income 6 Consider taxsavings strategies outside super As confirmed members can make to super from next financial year is 25000 a year without exceeding their contribution cap This is likely to encourage more super fund members to pursue taxsavings strategies outside super These strategies include the negativegearing of shares and property where appropriate from an investment perspective as well as incomesplitting by holding assets in the name of lowearning spouses and in family trusts Such strategies have long been favoured by trustees of rich SMSFs for their nonsuper money But never forget

quite familiar with Grandmother s House They have in the past referred women to this white building located on Euston Street in Charlottetown next to the former YMCA Grandmother s House met a need housing women for several months at a time offering crisis intervention employment counseling housing assistance and addiction counseling Women lined up at the door to get in Last year 29 women stayed Fifty others were turned away 20 because of substance use and mental health issues and another 30 simply due to lack of room at the shelter that was only able to house six residents a night At least five women have stayed at Anderson House in the last month that would normally have been referred to Grandmother s House said Danya OMalley manager of Anderson House On average 90 women and 60 children stay at Anderson House each year to leave violence who is also the data analyst for Homeless Individuals and Families Information System HIFIS opening a new shelter for women to fill the void left by Grandmother s House closing is the most pressing issue Sadly she is not aware of any effort underway to address the need The provincial government Docherty concedes does nt have the answer We re in all honesty allowing the community to take the lead on this she said The community services minister though says her department is willing to listen to groups and organizations looking to address homelessness in the province Shelters are in short supply in Prince Edward Island There is Anderson House There is a shelter in West Prince that has been operating since July 2007 for homeless women and female victims of domestic violence And there is Bedford MacDonald House a shelter for homeless men in Charlottetown Melissa Cooke coordinator of the shelter in West Prince on this facility that had about 600 bed nights last year Federal funding is in place to cover operating costs The other two shelters however face a constant challenge to sustain sufficient operating funds which is something Grandmother s House ultimately was unable to do Matusiewicz said the Anderson House board needs to fundraise as much as 20 per cent or 160000 of its 800000 operational budget At Bedford MacDonald House running a homeless shelter for men in Charlottetown on a shoestring budget led to desperate measures that included the board knowingly hiring a convicted pedophile Everett Galllant to keep watch over the facility The board closed the facility in June 2011 after Gallant was charged with sexually assaulting a homeless man who had been staying at the shelter Gallant was found guilty of the crime and sentenced to serve three years in jail A number of churches formed an ad hoc working group to work alongside the Bedford MacDonald board to reopen the shelter in late December Now the Salvation of the men s homeless shelter after earlier determining it could not afford to go ahead with such plans We re looking at it again said Lieut Ian Scott It s a very strong possibility Scott says the Salvation Army has an internal system for funding the shelter as well as commitments in principle from both the province and the City of Charlottetown to partner in the initiative Scott says Charlottetown really seems to struggle with the reality of homelessness It s really an invisible kind of group of people he said Ridgeway adds she would love to see a shelter opened for youth ages 16 to 19 They re couch surfing they re living with friends she said They re in the flop houses and they re getting into drugs Carl Doucette coordinator of the homeless partnership strategy with the John Howard Society says federal funding of 850000 was committed for 20112013 to be matched and the projects need to be sustainable for at least five years It s not a huge amount of money over three years however it does have some impact into community he said It is very challenging particularly to keep shelters going on a longterm basis The PEI Community Advisory Committee on Homelessness has raised concern with the waiting list for provincial family housing units remaining extensive The committee is also critical of the province for not developing or implementing a provincial poverty reduction strategy that includes units of family housing Matusiewicz echoed the alarm The need for affordable housing for someone to get back on their feet is a huge challenge he said Comments Comments Your

Ties Foster Care that Hon Valerie E Docherty could sit and get insight how her staff are there aiding places like these too be there making money etc hence should have an emeriti back up plan instead of O I m Surprised On the other side of the white house iswas and will be creating more women needing places like Grandmother s House home to women with no home as Donny ran the dark gray house that let girls and boys do as they please as long as they came in at curfew Valerie Docherty minister of community services and seniors in Child and Family Services have been steering girlswomen in the direction of Grandmother s House Anderson House as they seem to have the power to let girlsboys do as they wish tell parents no and Family Ties tell girls yes After being running loose girlsboys as adult continue lazy parents and Child and Family Services will always be there thus homeless homes will be too I raised eight and had some input with two others total 4 boys and 6 girls and it was a privilege too have influenced them in the direction they were to take One girl however speaking of marriage in doubt she was scared of the person she was to hitch I said do not we stop speaking It is as within the counseling for both parities in a family see the aforementioned and many more in Child and Family Services as it is a job that they bring the personal experience with them to the Job

Campbell I called Anderson House once after a 4 year old boy was beating the pole sticks out of his 28 year old mother and I had to get him to stop I asked Anderson House how they would teach a youngster to stop beating the holly grail out of their mother and she had no answer I said its in the money teaching them not to hit women would cut into the budget No Answer yet Wow The Native Council of PEI forced to close shop they say because the 80000 annual operating cost was too prohibitive they have a empty house in Cornwall for last eight months cutting into the budget must be Anderson House board needs 800000 operational budget I had eight on 17000 2000 and it would ve been 20000 maybe in 2012 a year budget wow what a bunch money money Why not Federal funding is on band

Homelessness At Bedford MacDonald House running a homeless shelter for men in Charlottetown on a shoestring budget led to desperate measures that included the board knowingly hiring a convicted pedophile Everett Galllant to keep watch over the facility That no stories emerged about the Board being held accountable is very disturbing in that incidence As for the women s shelter closing ensure there are no surprises and perhaps ensure that things are running as they should This is a no brainer no city should be without shelters for menwomen If we re judged on how we take care of our most vulnerable I d say we re not doing a very good job Townie are you as stupid as your post suggests or are you just a useless troll making useless comments If you had read the story if you can read you would have seen the Native Council closed the shelter but did not inform government nor ask for help to keep it open Even the PEI Family Violence Prevention Services did not know it was closing Next time ask your kids to read the stories to you Making a difference When Lori Rogers saw the slumlike conditions some St John s residents were living in she felt determined to do something to help It was heartbreaking she said to see an old wire hanger hooked into a door in place of a knob to be asked by an elderly couple whether she could replace their stove only one burner worked one of the seniors told her The bathrooms in several apartments were so run down Rogers says it was difficult to fathom how anyone could feel comfortable in such conditions What made the situations that much worse was that many of the people living in the apartments were on income support and battling mental illnesses After seeing too many people living in deplorable apartments Rogers formed Right Turn Investments in 2009 and started purchasing and restoring older homes I was so embarrassed to be buying those properties knowing how poor they looked the 44yearold says Her goal was them to single parents people with mental health issues those leaving shelters former inmates of Her Majesty s Penitentiary and others who many landlords would turn their backs on Rogers bought her first rental property at 21 She currently rents 19 one and twobedroom apartments in nine homes in St John s and has formed partnerships within the community to help her make her tenants feel at home Whether it s a local carpet factory donating a piece of flooring a furniture company offering some surplus product or a builder giving away a set of stairs the partnerships are what set her business apart from others in the real estate industry Rogers has also partnered with St Thomas Anglican Church to collect donations of furniture and appliances and other necessities for her tenants The church is renting a storage unit where the donations are stored until needed The partnerships are where we are able to save money and then put the savings into another property she says Volunteers from the church pitch in and help clean up the homes once she buys them she says Lori gives them some respect It s not people telling them what to do anymore It s Lori requesting their help And that s really good positive reinforcement Cullen says Listening to vulnerable people is nt new to Rogers She worked as an activity coordinator at St Luke s Homes in St John s for over a decade and in a longterm care facility in Ontario for five years where she cared for people with Alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia Whatever the work her outlook on life is simple treat people with respect and get it back in return People are human and sometimes all you need is to listen to somebody And I tell my clients I m not above you I m right here by you Trudy WhiteMorgan has been living in one of Rogers apartments for about eight years Rogers has brought says She s been wonderful to me She helped me out when I was basically lower than low WhiteMorgan says The low point in her life was when her husband walked out on her and her young daughter Lori and Roxanne were there for me emotionally They gave me an ear when I really needed it Rogers lowered the rent when MorganWhite became a single parent MorganWhite helped in return by looking after the two other apartments in the building MorganWhite s daughter Morgan is now eight years old Rogers has been particularly good to her daughter through the years she says taking her to movies and to a show at Mile One Centre During a visit to their home Morgan reached for the stuffed reindeer with red and green bells tied to its antlers that Rogers gave her for Christmas You put him on the table and turn him on and he sings a song and bumps around and around giving the toy a squeeze before placing him back on a shelf MorganWhite says she s grateful to Rogers for giving her a place to call home for the long term It s great to have someone other than her elderly father and brothers to depend on she says Lori has always been kind to me and Morgan And I know if it comes to the crunch her and Roxanne will be here for me Rev John Paul Westin rector of St Thomas Church says Rogers is making a difference in many people s lives His congregation and other people in the community are quick to donate items for her apartments he says as they know they are helping vulnerable people A lot of landlords are nt interested in having people with mental health problems as tenants Lori is providing the housing but she s also providing support and friendship Almost like a family relationship Comments Comments Your nameEmailComment Recent You are two very caring ladies However as already mentioned this is not just a problem for the mentally ill or social assistance recipients it is rampant for the lower income working class Also a lot of OAS income people are involved in this dilemma But the two of you are certainly doing more than your share God bless you and your little dog Lori you sound like an excellent member of society who cares for people I wish you the best This is not just a problem now for the mental ill and people who are on social assistance or for only the lower class There is a general crisis for everyone Whether poor or middle class many are suffering Slumlords are everywhere I was recently in a fire because of a slumlord and I was paying a lot in rent I made this article on thescopeca http 700TOOLONG and I made a facebook page with a petition http 3072TOOLONG id100003884262334 Canada approves historic lifesaving stemcell drug for children Canada has become the first country to greenlight the world s first approved drug that has stem cells as its active ingredient offering hope to children suffering from an extremely painful disease that kills up to 80 percent of children affected I am very proud of the leadership role Canada has taken in advancing stem cell therapy and particularly gratified that this historic decision benefits children who would otherwise have little hope said Andrew Daly MD Clinical Associate Professor Department of Medicine and Oncology at the University of Calgary Canada according to a press release As the National Institutes of Health explains the immune system as the body s tool to fight infection and disease works by seeing harmful cells as foreign and attacking them When children receive a donor s stem cells the graft their job is to recreate the donor s immune system in the child s body the graft versus host disease GvHD the leading cause of transplant related deaths is the term used when immune cells contained within transplanted bone marrow see the recipient s organs as foreign and attack them causing potentially severe damage to the skin liver and digestive tract stomach cramps especially before and during bowel movements and after eating persistent nausea How is GVHD treated Doctors try using steroids to stop the attack but they only have a success rate of 3050 percent which is why many children can die within just weeks of diagnosis the press release states In Canada Prochymal is now authorized for the management of acute GvHD in children who fail to respond to steroids Prochymal developed by Osiris Therapeutics is an intravenous formulation of mesenchymal stem cells MSCs which are derived from the bone marrow of healthy adult donors between the ages of 18 and 30 years The MSCs are selected from the bone marrow and grown can be produced from a single donor Because these are adult stem cells they do not raise the ethical concerns of embryonic stem cells whose creation usually involves the destruction of human embryos Reuters adds As the New York Times notes stem cells are already used in medicine Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are used to treat various cancers and genetic diseases But those transplants are medical procedures not products sold by a drug company As a result of Health Canada s comprehensive review physicians now have an offtheshelf stem cell therapy in their arsenal to fight GvHD Much like the introduction of antibiotics in the late 1920 s with stem cells we have now officially taken the first step into this new paradigm of medicine Daly said Principal Investigator in the clinical program for Prochymal Today is not only a great day for Osiris but for everyone involved in the responsible development of stem cell therapies said C Randal Mills PhD importantly today is a great day for children and their families who bravely face this horrific disease While today marks the first approval of a stem cell drug now that the door has been opened it will surely not be the last Mills said Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration indicated that it would require more data before approval prompting Osiris to seek approval in Canada first according to the Times He said the company would apply to the FDA later this year More than 96000 in rent owed by Hakour Enterprises Ltd The store operated by Hakour Enterprises Ltd finally closed its doors late last week with no explanation to its customers or the community other than a notice from the sheriff s office that now hangs on the door That piece of paper a notice of distress reads that the grocery store and assets contained were seized on May 10 by the sheriff on behalf of CA Realty Ltd for rent owing of 9628890 from Nov 9 2010 to May 2 2012 Unless the said rent with charges for distraining the same is paid in

unexpected closure has caused They just showed up and closed them down said Burton about the closure of Valu Foods It decreased traffic flow which is not necessarily a good thing It creates some sort of a controversy that people assume if they are closing we are also closing It was business as usual on Friday at the pharmacy as fresh fruit meat eggs and cheese sat to rot on the nearby shelves of the nearby Valu Foods Food aisles surrounding the pharmacy are cordoned off each blocked by empty metal the sheriff It s somewhat of a seamless sort of business Appearance is everything but they are

s shelves as they wait to fill their prescriptions We were in the midst of arranging to move anyway so we re moving into a larger site next to Dr Harold Molyneaux in a couple of weeks said Burton That was already prearranged We were already moving and expanding because we re outgrowing our space This kind of put a fly in the ointment for a couple of weeks and a scramble of what to do at the last

Rail Network Rail fears a tragedy could happen if people continue running across level crossings as the barriers come down There have been several incidents of pedestrians who have still been on the tracks as the barriers are lowered around them They have now released CCTV pictures highlighting the number of people trying to cross when it s not safe Rail bosses say the problem is particularly bad at two crossings in Lincoln City Centre We regularly see people rushing across the level crossings at Lincoln High Street and Brayford Wharf once the warnings have started Clearly this behaviour is highly reckless and dangerous Phil Verster route managing director for Network Rail In one instance a man was caught on camera lifting the barriers to run across the tracks One man was caught on CCTV

your ad blocker at least for this website Jaguars owner Shahid Khan has been unequivocal regarding his desire to keep the team in Jacksonville He has adopted the city as a home away from home He has spent on free agents and he plans to spend on improving the team s facilities He has donated 1 million to a veteran s guidance center And he s now embroiled in a fullblown fight with City officials In a May 30 letter to Mayor Alvin Brown obtained by the Jacksonville Business Journal Khan accuses the City of violating the lease agreement that allows the franchise to play at Everbank Field The dispute arises from the fairly mundane task of hiring a manager for the facility Khan contends that Section 25E of the lease requires the Jaguars to upon reviewing the submitted proposals make a recommendation to Jacksonville City officials then will evaluate the proposals after the Jaguars make the recommendation The City apparently believes that the two parties must converse about the situation before any recommendations are made and that a lawyer representing Jacksonville then sent the team a letter declaring the franchise to be in default and putting in motion a termination of our lease As we said Uh Oh The action of sending the default letter is unprecedented Khan writes The default mechanism of the lease has not been implemented in the 18 years the lease has been in effect While we certainly take the default claim seriously the only response we can make to your letter is to cure the claimed default However it is not possible to cure as we are in full compliance with the lease Mayor I hope you can understand that I am shocked and perplexed at the City s actions I am at a loss to understand the purpose of this drastic and unprecedented action I am hopeful that the letter is as a result of an overzealous lawyer and not the result of the philosophy of your administration in dealing with the partnership between sought to comply exactly with our lease obligations Khan then requests Brown to advise us of the method of your implementation of the default and termination if that is your intention Khan adds We are on the cusp of training camp to begin the NFL season and will need to act quickly Again Uh Oh The fact that Jacksonville is initiating the termination process seems very odd unless Jacksonville perceives that it can derive a benefit that somehow outweighs the costs of possibly giving the team the ability to you know move And it s hard not to at least wonder whether Khan s response is aimed to provoking a fight that eventually would give him the ability to you know move In the interim we ll track down a copy of the lease and try to make sense of who s right and who s wrong There does nt seem to be much middle ground on this one either the Jaguars nt It feels like something bigger is happening here but it s hard to imagine the lease disintegrating simply because the Jaguars recommended the hiring of a facilities manager Even if the action constitutes a violation of the lease it does nt seem like the kind of thing that could result in the lease imploding and the Jaguars relocating Just FYI My home away from home is a black Benz limo with a cellular phone patriotsdefense saysMay 30 2012 627 PM It is very odd indeed If the lease is broken by the team I know the city gets a huge lump sum of money I think it s 30 million But that number could have gone up after that extension signed by Weaver the former owner This is very odd because secretly this is exactly what the team wants Khan wanted to buy the Rams in STL I think he s going to get his wish to return to his home town of STL after the Rams return to LA to see the city of Jacksonville give up any leverage of keeping an NFL team The NFL will not return Jaguars fans pick the Falcons 300 miles north or the Bucs 170 southwest or the Dolphins 350 miles south BHA and to think Florida said no thanks to high speed rail The lawyer that sent the letter claiming the Jaguars had defaulted on the lease has promptly backtracked From the news4jaxcom story When we received your letter dated May 24 2012 that the Jacksonville Jaguars have selected SMG as the EverBank Field facility manager I was surprised General Counsel Cindy Laquidara wroter in a letter Jaguars president Mark Lamping until this afternoon I was unaware of the change to the RFP agreed to by Ms Chastain in contravention to my April 30 2012 letter to Mr Brown Please consider this my withdrawal of that default Laquidara wrote Given the longstanding positive relationship between the Jaguars and the City and new information a misunderstanding on this matter I hereby withdraw any notice of default It would be more productive for representatives from the Jaguars and the City to meet and see if we can resolve any concerns that either party has tfbuckfutter saysMay 30 2012 631 PM Is the mayor of Jacksonville James Bond Because he is the only man who could get away with crossing someone sporting that mustache Sounds suspicious since no way Jags could up and leave for LA this year with no place to play and no arrangements made otherwise Waiting for more info or if we got it already thanks to Charles Fenwick above then its just another PFT gag oh wait report because after all these are journalists Right This is very odd because secretly this is exactly what the team wants Khan wanted to buy the Rams in STL I think he s going to get his wish to return to his home town of STL after the Rams return to Except that the Rams are not moving to LA 1st off should StLouis actually terminate their lease with the Rams they are not eligible to move until March 2015 which also happens to be the same time the builder of the new stadium said he would not wait til to get a new team Secondly Raiders Chargers and Jags all are much higher in the running to move Thirdly The Rams offer to upgrade the stadium is not a ridiculious or absurd offer It looks like a legit practical offer and not one made out of desperation to move but really upgrade And then add in the fact that the owners upped the loan to 300 million for stadium renovations and that just makes it all the more likely The estimates to update the EJD is somewhere between 200600 mill depending on who you ask but the real number is probably somewhere in between Yea Doubt the Rams are moving since they saysMay 30 2012 647 PM London Jaguars has a ring to it maddenisfordorks saysMay 30 2012 649 PM Ugh It seems like the entire national media just wants to take turns smearing feces all over my jags they ll work this out OR we can just do the whole unfounded LA speculation thing peppered with trash talk ugh I m so glad the vikes got their stadium so I do nt have to hear LA Vikings anymore Welcome to months of LA Jaguars speculation jagsfan9674 saysMay 30 2012 653 PM jrod613 says May 30 2012 650 PM ugh I m so glad the vikes got their stadium so I do nt have to hear LA Vikings anymore Welcome to months of LA Jaguars speculation Except LA Jaguars speculation has been going on for 4 years now It s a little bit of a tired joke now This story was posted 10 minutes to soon 5 mins or so after the story You re all blind This is all Khan s doing He s concocting a pretend fight started by the city in order to give him a reason to move out of that wasteland patriotsdefense saysMay 30 2012 708 PM iced107 says May 30 2012 646 PM Yea Doubt the Rams are moving since they re serious about staying in the Lou I have nothing against STL The accepted conventional wisdom is that the new Rams owners intentionally asked for the moon because they do nt want to stay in STL The figures you mentioned are not want the Rams asked for That s what the city wants to do with the Edwards Dome The Rams proposal had a price tag of a minimum of 700 million with the addition of a retractable roof I do nt think the Jaguars will be so ardent with their demands for improvements that is if Khan returns home to STL oldcracker saysMay 30 2012 709 PM I always Khan smiling I have a feeling there is a lawyer for the city of Jacksonville who is in some deep doodoo right now Particularly when you read the new report with the city backtracking and now withdrawing the claim of default And as for the team moving to LA ai nt going to happen I have been convinced for a long time the Chargers will be the team to go to LA They have been in need of a new stadium deal longer than any other team Also with being right down the coast many of the teams fans would stick with them My guess is the NFL already knows they will eventually move to LA But until they do the vacancy of a franchise in LA will be used by the NFL as a bargaining chip for any team needing a stadium just as it was in Minnesota I ca nt understand why any city would do anything to jeopardize losing their team I also ca nt understand why any team would bother an abject failure Will Art Rooney amp Roger Gooddell make a special visit this time like in MN granadafan saysMay 30 2012 737 PM jagsfan9674 says May 30 2012 653 PM Except LA Jaguars speculation has been going on for 4 years now It s a little bit of a tired joke now This story was posted 10 minutes to soon 5 mins or so after the story was posted the city withdrew it s claim of default 4493TOOLONG You re missing the point by blaming the media for posting the story The city s claim of default was an incredibly poor decision Instead of simply picking up the phone and ASKING the Jags for clarification they let the idiotic lawyer send the Jags an inflammatory accusation That claim of default was like a line in the sand stance by the city Whoever signed off on the letter before it was sent out should be fired along with the lawyer This was a PR disaster for the city and team who will likely look upon any interaction with the city with great and welldeserved suspicion patriotsdefense says May 30 2012 708 PM iced107 says May 30 2012 646 PM I have nothing against STL The accepted conventional wisdom is that the new Rams owners intentionally asked for the moon because they do nt want to stay in STL The figures you mentioned are not want the Rams asked for That s what the city wants to do with the Edwards Dome The Rams proposal had a price tag of a minimum of 700 million with the addition of a retractable roof I do nt think the Jaguars will be so ardent with their demands for improvements that is if Khan returns home to STL You art partially right The 700 million is the highest it was said to be though Although those figures are nt the same Another contractor has also estimated it to to ask After arbitration its supposed to be somewhere in between those two probably around the 450500 million mark which is not unreasonable And if the city accepts the offer the contract is binding and the Rams can not move until 2025 And again what the Rams asked for was not the moon nor has been the contract been deemed unncessary You need to read some articles man everything in the local has been saying Kroenke s offer is NOT unreasonable and appeals to look like a legit plan to upgrade the stadium while also shooting for a superbowl appearance footballisfun saysMay 30 2012 837 PM If they move I hope it s London I just love hearing Jaguars pronounced with a British accent blueglaze saysMay 30 2012 1001 PM Baha all comments on this thread about the jags moving are now proven to be moronic Fact read latest article Hahahaha GO jAGS Related Topics A subsidiary of furniture retailer Ikea is logging oldgrowth forests and other high conservation value forests in western Russia according to the Global Forestry Coalition GFC an alliance of NGOs from more than 40 countries alleges that Ikea s wholly owned logging subsidiary Swedwood has been clearcutting forests in high biodiversity value areas and logging very old trees in parts of the Russian Karelia region The furniture giant uses the We Love Wood slogan to highlight its claim to use only wood sourced in an environmentally and socially responsible way Swedwood is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council GFC has also criticized NEPCon the company that ensures that the company s facilities are FSCcompliant GFC has called NEPCon allowing the logging of oldgrowth trees under the FSC banner a scandal Ikea says that the average age of the trees that its harvests in Karelia is 160 years The company also says that what s vital when looking at total forest management is not the age earlier logging but proper management that plans the logging in accordance with good conservation procedures and biodiversity In a response to GFC s claims Ikea said that some 17 percent of of Swedwood s total leasehold in Karelia is exempt from cutting either by legislative demand or voluntarily Ikea says this is a far greater proportion of land than legally required Furthermore when the leasehold s limits were determined in 2004 Ikea says it gave up areas of about nine percent of the total leasehold following dialogue with Greenpeace as the natural values of these areas were considered too high to conduct responsible forestry The company says the new pallets can support the same load as traditional timber pallets but are just onethird the height at two inches high This means Ikea can fit more goods into each shipment The cardboard pallets are also only 55 pounds 90 percent lighter than their predecessor Earlier this week Greenpeace accused KFC is using wood from rainforests to make its packaging The Pulp amp Paper to make such things as chicken buckets french fry cartons and drinks containers the environmental organization said Reader Comments Important issue does not seem to be well summarized toward a solutionaction and I do not understand why KFC was brought in We have much work to do to build a sustainable world let s be as organized and effective in our efforts as we can be Thanks As the FSC certification service provider to Swedwood Karelia we would like to explain more about NEPCon s role and the FSC certification process We welcome comments from stakeholders and we take them very seriously That is why we conducted a followup field audit last year based on formal complaints over Swedwood Karelia s forest management regime including logging in oldgrowth forest We are always willing to address and correct any possible error in our auditing work However our followup audit did not reveal any nonconformances with the applicable FSC Forest Management standards as professional FSC auditors we do not and may not It is also important to understand that the Russian FSC Forest Management certification standard has been developed by key Russian stakeholders following FSC s procedures that require balanced influence by environmental social and economic interests CNN Twenty five years ago President Reagan gave a speech in West Berlin where he exhorted Mr Gorbachev to tear down this wall Two years later the barbed wire and wall that was a symbol of oppression came crashing down ending decades of tyranny and leading to one of the greatest expansions of freedom and liberty in the 20th Century America has its own Berlin Wall It is called K12 education As schools let out for summer vacation far too many parents particularly lowincome parents are trapped behind the wall of their zip code or family income They have no real freedom to send their child to a school that works best for them and far too often they are forced to attend woefully underperforming schools or schools that just do nt meet their child s individual learning needs This can not go on Instead we must tear down the Berlin Wall that holds back parents from being able to pick the school that Thankfully in the last two years education reform and school choice have become front and center in America As Mitt Romney said last week we must put an end to the millions of children in our nation who receive a third world education And President Obama said Michelle and I are here only because we were given a chance at an education I will not settle for an America where some kids do nt have that chance The first step in tearing down the educational Berlin Wall is to give parents particularly lowincome parents and parents of special needs students more freedom of choice Programs such as the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program are lifesavers for thousands of children and are steps in the right direction However all kids should have access to quality educational options and no child should be excluded for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with an individual child s needs Milton Friedman the Nobel laureate economist and father of the school choice concept give all parents the freedom to choose The greater the potential for schools to lose customers the more likely you will see schools improve Just like the millions of East Germans who demanded freedom we know that there are millions of parents that want to be removed from a system that uses a zip code to determine where their children must attend school They want more school choice Earlier this month The Friedman Foundation released a poll by Braun Research Inc that showed 71 percent of Moms with schoolaged children support school vouchers for all students only 30 percent of these Moms believed vouchers should be allocated based on financial need or disability We often hear from Moms that their children have unique circumstances that may require more individualized attention that can only be found in a private school Moms seeking school choice sometimes want other options because their children may be in an unsafe environment Or they may believe their public school may not share their cultural social or spiritual values Or school just does nt perform well enough to address their child s learning needs and thus will negatively impact their child s future academic success They are telling the education monopoly they want options They do not want to be held behind the Berlin Wall of their zip code and told where their child must be sent to school Moms and all voters are starting to tell educators they want options so children are nt destined to one track in life As Romney pointed out a third world education is not uncommon in our nation And when children receive such an education they are more likely to be unemployed on government assistance or in jail or in prison when they become adults Vouchers not only provide freedom they offer the political moral ethical and economical high ground We say Moms know best Vouchers should be made available to children no matter if they are poor disabled from the middle class or from a family of 10 or There should be no restrictions on who gets to choose just like there were no restrictions on who could escape tyranny once the Berlin Wall fell The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Enlow soundoff 16 Responses j young I am all for vouchers Why should parents have to send their children to schools that continually fail them I pulled my daughter from the public school system when she was in kindergarten She had been diagnosed with learning disorders including dyslexia and dysgraphia and had spent the year with a teacher who ripped up papers and scribbled on her work with a red marker when my daughter would write things backwards After doing the IEP we were told that although she had learning problems her intelligence testing scored too high to allow them to classify her as learning disabled but they could classify her as ADHD NOT the problem and allow her to meet with a social worker once a month We pulled her out and put she is still struggles but is working at grade level and gets A s on all of her tests because the school was willing to provide accomodations that the public school simply would nt We recently had her reevaluated with the same results and considered returning to the public school because tuition costs were so high only to find that after reviewing all of the testing and the IEP the school was nt still only willing to provide minimal assistance I say bring on the vouchers I ve seen the difference the right school and environment makes firsthand Our children deserve more than an education They deserve every opportunity for success that can be providedand if the public schools ca nt do it parents should have options June 6 2012 at 745 pm Teri Vouchers will not solve the problem because private and charter schools have a huge advantage that public schools do not have they can limit their size They do nt have to take everybody or anybody that wants to come to Sorry we are full or Sorry we do nt provide the special services a child like yours needs you will have to take himher to another school or even Your child is not a good fit for our school We have rules and behavior expectations and your child has not met them You will have to find another school for your child What will the government do when they issue a bunch of vouchers but the charter and private schools are full Or when the charter and private schools wo nt take those students These schools run by their own rules They can decide how many students they want in a classroom they can decide what curriculum to use they can decide if they want to provide extra resources for struggling students and they do not have to administer standarized test s to ensure that their students are making adequet growth and progress They can claim to be better than public schools but unless their students take the exact I have taught in both public AND private schools In my experience the public schools do a MUCH better job of helping struggling students And as an earlier post said these struggling students are the most expensive Private and charter schools do nt want to spend the money to give these students the help they need but public schools are REQUIRED to Some students struggle because of learning disabilites that have nothing to do with their socioeconomic status or home life But many many students struggle because they are so disadvantaged I have students with very very sad life stories And yet we take them we do our best to overcome the huge obsticals to learning that their home life puts in our way These parents wo nt even sign a homework folder or read at home to their kids do you really think they are going to apply for a voucher research schools and then drive them to school and pick them up every day These experts classroom Would you hire a roofing expert to fix your leaking roof that had never been on one before Would you hire a legal expert to defend you against a frivilous lawsuit because they served time as a juror I know all about education because I went to school June 5 2012 at 624 pm The 1 Diablo Guide Usually I do nt learn article on blogs but I would like to say that this writeup very forced me to take a look at and do it Your writing style has been amazed me Thanks quite great post June 5 2012 at 739 am Maria J I am fed up with politics in schools What happened to educating the child It s not difficult Teachers need to teach to the best of their ability and if they are not performing they need to go back to school There s no shame in getting the tools you need to be better at what expect the students to come to tutorials when they need help so why ca nt teachers set the example It s gotten so difficult in letting teachers go Why Maybe we can learn something from Donald Trump You re fired In the real world if you re not productive you get a chance maybe two and then you are let go Why do we accept mediocrity when it comes to our children They are our most valuable asset And the parents Well being in the best schools because they can meet your child s needs better is nt going to help if you do nt do your job as a parent You still have to take time with your child The schools and the teachers ca nt do it all Parents do nt want to parent and in defense of some they do nt know how and leave everything to the schools Well why do nt you just sign over custody papers to the school while you it s challenging and timeconsuming but it s worth it Let s all try to do our jobs whether we re parents teachers or politicians and let us not forget those we work for the children June 1 2012 at 115 am Aaron In a system like this dubbed educational apartheid by one Chilean professor only students from wealthier families can afford to access quality education while all others must take out expensive educational loans saddling them with enormous debt Milton Friedman s philosophy led to the military dictatorships that killed 1000 s of people in the Southern Cone of South America Pure evil In fact Pinochet targeted educators How ironic Let the local community reform the schools Get rid of all of the bureaucracy and mandates Teachers ca nt do their jobs because of the pyramid scheme called privatization Pump in billions of dollars tie the hands of teachers blame them based on trivial data private company All this at the expense of the kids Create a crisis I mean propaganda like in this writers opinion and stooges believe Mandates restrict the school of reforming on it s own The school does not need a private company to run the school system As a parent I am outraged at our inept government A Congress with the lowest approval rating ever should not be reforming our public schools Chile s voucher system is a disaster and do nt trust anyone from the Friedman Foundation May 31 2012 at 1148 am Melissa Vouchers are fine as long as the receiving schools are also held to the same standards as public schools They must accept ALL students and provide an appropriate education for each of those students no matter how costly their needs Students may not dismissed from a school due to behavior problems or lack of academic drive May 30 2012 at 824 pm JEM Given the level of damage that the public education system receivers to fail Why would you place such restrictions upon them What is your objection to schools who specialize May 31 2012 at 217 pm Jeremy Vouchers will build barbed wire around the Berlin wall Yes parents will have more choices for their child s education But the millions of children whose choice of school is based solely on location will suffer greatly Low income neighborhoods do nt have schools that parent from high socioeconomic backgrounds will send their children to These schools will be underfunded causing lower socioeconomic familes to receive a sub par education The education system is suppose to help end the cycle of poverty the voucher sysytem will act as a catalyst May 30 2012 at 613 pm Eric Andersen Romney used the latest PISA scores to say that our students are getting a thirdworld education When US schools are broken out by poverty level and compared to other countries with similar poverty levels the US is in first place in every poverty that we educate all of our children unlike most other countries Comparing apples to apples the US has the by far the best K12 public education system in the world Can we improve Of course we can This Repub claim that US public education system is broken is an outright lie How can it be broken when we are doing a better job than every other country in the world Do we spend more per pupil on education than most other countries Yes we do What group of students are the most expensive to educate The bottom 25 The very same bottom 25 that most other countries do not educate and do not include in their statistics May 30 2012 at 130 pm Skeptic Please cite your sources sir As an educational researcher I can tell you that your points are not true We are outperformed when comparing apples to apples There are districts in both China and several of the Nordic countries that greatly outperform even a subsample of our students does have a statistical impact on our scores it is not a completely moderating effect It is simply an excuse given when somebody does not tear into the statistics for themselves You can also pull some of our top performing middle and high schools in the nation out of the data set and they do not compare to top districts in some of the other locations of the world If you have other information please cite it Your article compared Finland s and other OECD countries poverty rate to the US Actually before social transfers Finland s poverty rate is similar to United States but after social transfers it drops dramatically Can I assume from your citation that you wish lower the poverty rate in the United States Maybe that will help our kids perform better May 31 2012 at 246 am Eric Andersen Lowering the poverty rate would be great but it is not the point of my post The point of my post is that it is not that US public schools providing education to students who live in thirdworld poverty As the linked article states one of the very few linear relationships that exist in these statistics is the povertyacademic achievement relationship The US is doing a better job of educating students despite their poverty than any other country in the world May 31 2012 at 140 pm ChristyG As a teacher what do we do with failing students We enroll them in special education programs We get them tutors We provide as many supports as we can to get them to pass and hopefully graduate or at least get a GED so that they can be participating members of society and function at their best We nurture them and encourage them to focus on positive things and push them to their fullest potential even if it is only a C Average All so that they can have a good life once they leave the school environment As a government what do we do with failing schools We cut funding based on underperformance with students from families that have little or no income and ca nt read to their children every night to support their education We give teachers merit pay or fire them based on test scores that they really have little control over We cut cut cut If we did that to failing students would there not be outrage If we decided that students who fail should just be cut out of school Why is it okay to have current educational trends be moving toward Positive Behavioral and Academic Support but our government concentrating on all negatives As public school employees we are trying so hard to focus on what kids do well and recognize them for it to encourage those positive things and NOT focus on the negatives Yes government let s put in Merit pay and focus on the who is the best while creating a resentful and noncooperative environment among teachers Let s cut away at everything our neighborhood What good is having the choice when the nearest school that you choose is miles away Especially when you may have a perfectly good school right down the street that people who have never taught a day in their life deem as unfit or underperforming I challenge any government official that is making decisions for the fate of public education to step into a classroom for a day to do the job of a teacher for just a little while and to be held accountable for those kids that eat all of their meals for the day at that neighborhood school Those kids that were up all night taking care of their siblings because there are no functioning adults in the household Those kids at age 10 that know more about the streets than most adults know Please let s focus on what schools do well Let s support our schools that need help Let s make sure that our neighborhood schools can function so that the family that does nt own a vehicle does nt have to be Let s do what our schools are doing and create positive rewards and supports for all who may need support and encouragement to do better Let s foster an environment of cooperation and ingenuity to make sure we can work with what we have even if it s not much Teachers are fabulous people They work wonders with what they are given and they touch lives forever They turn kids into Presidents CEO s Mothers Fathers Forbes 500 names celebrities even Let s appreciate them Let s fund our schools and make each school a wonderful place to learn Time to focus on the positive people May 30 2012 at 921 am JEM Do a Google search for Ball Tapping Dropout Factory or Bullying and one might conclude that our public schools do nt do much of anything well accept train kids for careers as prison inmates May 31 2012 at 224 pm Aaron The Friedman Foundation jail system is happening Bottom line is you need people in jail to profit America s culture will always produce inmates Bottom line for profit is an out of control evil in this country From destroying our environment to creating resentment abroad this country is in a downward spiral As Mitt and our rogue Supreme Court says Corporations are people Liberty after all is only for the Aristocrats Corporations have the liberty to oppress the masses Vouchers would do the same My community should be able to reform the schools in my districts Not some bum from DC or
